The Total Dividend stands at `23/- per share, for F.Y. 2018-19.Market Leadership
We maintained our strong leadership positions in both, the toothpaste and toothbrush categories, with volume market shares for the year 2018 at 52.4% and 45.2%, respectively.Colgate is India’s No. 1 Most Trusted Oral Care BrandFor the eighth consecutive  year,  Colgate  ranked  as  India’s  #1 Most Trusted Oral Care Brand in The Economic Times Brand Equity Most Trusted Brands Survey - 2018, a consumer survey conducted in collaboration with Nielsen. We sincerely thank you for your trust.Driving Growth is Our Key PriorityWe work towards achieving a sustainable profitable business growth with brand building activities and a sharp focus on innovation, supported by a strong advertising investment.To reinvigorate Colgate’s flagship brand and India’s largest selling toothpaste - Colgate Strong  Teeth,  the brand  was  re-launched with a thought-provoking consumer communication of ‘Andar Se Strong’ moment reflected as ‘Bahar Se Smiles.’ The TV commercials featured the real stories of India’s popular icons Deepika Padukone and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, highlighting how they face life’s tough moments with self- belief and a smile.Colgate Total got a brand refresh with an advanced formula of Dual Zinc and Arginine. It provides superior protection to problem causing germs. The brand proposition was communicated through a new campaign persuading people to ‘Upgrade to Whole Mouth Health.’Continuing the momentum in our ‘Naturals’ segment, a 360° marketing campaign for Swarna Vedshakti leveraged leading celebrities Kajol and Jyothika. Additionally, through strong region-specific communication, Vedshakti asserted its presence at major festivals in India, throughout
the year. It is pertinent to mention that at Kumbh, the world’s largest congregation of pilgrims, our campaign, ‘Kumbh Se Sampoorna Shuddhi, Colgate Vedshakti Se Sampoorna Suraksha,’ ensured the exposure of our brand to one in every five visitors through impactful outdoor advertising, Kumbh related utility accessories like Suraksha- wristbands and Suraksha-ropes, and large-scale sampling with sachet packs.Focusing on the children’s portfolio we launched the new Colgate Kids Toothpaste integrated marketing communication of ‘Make brushing fun,’ leveraging the much-loved, popular characters of Batman, Barbie and Motu-Patlu. This new communication was amplified across digital platforms, in addition to in-store engagements and exciting promotions.We recently introduced Colgate ProClinical 150 Toothbrush in the market. This technology led innovation is a battery operated toothbrush that is tough on plaque yet gentle on gums.We have expanded the Palmolive equity to a new category of Palmolive Facial Bars. Available in 3 exciting variants of Vitamin C&E, Turmeric & Tamarind, and Charcoal, the facial cleansing bars were launched with a high impact campaign across multiple consumer touch-points in digital and social channels, in-stores and outdoors.Bringing Alive Colgate’s Brand PurposeIn line with our brand purpose - ‘Everyone Deserves a Future They Can Smile About,’ we recently launched Colgate’s equity campaign – ‘Smile Karo Aur Shuru Ho Jao’ or Get Started with a Smile. This brand expression underscores Colgate’s message of hope and optimism through the positive power of a smile. While embarking on life’s significant new journeys when we feel overwhelmed or unsure, it is our smile that boosts our courage and nudges us to better places. The campaign was
introduced through two new TV commercials, on one of the biggest sporting events in India, the IPL.Stepping Up the GameIn order to enhance our equity with the ‘Profession,’ we continue to create relevant opportunities for scientific engagements. We recently organized a lecture series by Dental Experts on Product Technologies, across 40 cities in India, which was much appreciated by the dentist community.In e-commerce, our focus on understanding shopper trends and catering to their requirements effectively, has tripled our growth in the last year.And, in traditional trade platforms, our successful implementation of Mission Vistaar has led to a considerable increase in our direct distribution, across the country.Our Commitment to Social ActionCaring for the health and safety of our environment, people and communities, is an integral part of Colgate. It gives me great pleasure to share with you that Colgate is the first Company in India to be recognized by the Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI) with TRUE Zero Waste Platinum certification for all four of our manufacturing sites. The principles of ‘Reduce -Reuse- Recycle’ have become a way of life for all of us at Colgate.For over eighty years we have been committed to Keep India Smiling through several community programs that aim to create a significant positive impact in the lives of people.Our long running, pan-India flagship program Bright Smiles, Bright Futures™ (BSBF), which has been providing foundational oral health education, since 1976, to school children across urban and rural India has reached over 162 million children so far.Oral Health Month (OHM), an annual initiative that we started in 2004 to offer free dental consultation and check-ups to people across the country, has benefitted about 40 million people so far.Seva Mandir, an Udaipur based NGO, partnered with Colgate in 2013. Together, we have supported the cause of education for underprivileged children from tribal areas of Rajasthan. As part of this association, in 2016, we launched the ‘Colgate Seva Mandir Education Scholarship Program’ which supports children with overall grooming and quality education at the Vidya Mandir school. Additionally, Colgate also helps to enhance Vidya Mandir’s learning facilities and infrastructure.Taking this partnership with Seva Mandir further, recently, we also started a livelihood-based women-empowerment program in nine tribal villages of Udaipur. For the beneficiaries, the income from this
program is not only a means to build their self-reliance, but also to improve their quality of life and of those around them.Saksham, our employability-linked skill development program to empower the underprivileged and marginalised youth, has trained more than 900 candidates across the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, since 2016.Colgate has partnered with NGO, ActionAid to support children, primarily girls, from marginalised communities in villages around Baddi in Himachal Pradesh. The program focuses on building their computer and language skills and helps with their personality grooming. More than 500 children have been enrolled in F.Y.2018-19 in mixed-model schools run together by the government and community.‘Save Water’ is the cornerstone of Colgate’s sustainability mission. We realise that people in regions without water, struggle with their basic daily existence. Through our partnership with NGO, Water for People- India Trust, water availability has been enabled in regions of Bihar, West Bengal, and most recently, in Amravati district of Maharashtra. Additionally, Colgate’s water augmentation  program  with  NGO Seva Mandir, ensures water accessibility to tribal villages of Udaipur, Rajasthan.We will continue to grow and develop our community programs with the objective of building strong foundations to create a meaningful difference in people’s lives.OutlookWe remain focused on maximizing growth and productivity. Guided by our ethics and core values of Caring, Teamwork, and Continuous Improvement, we continue to draw upon our foundational strategies of investing in our brands and delivering innovative products. With our pragmatic and committed teams, we are confident that we will continue to create value for our shareholders over the long-term.I wish to thank all Colgate  people  for  their  unstinted  efforts,  year on year, towards attaining our goals. I would also like to express my sincere appreciation for the trust and support that we receive from our customers, suppliers, shareholders and directors which enables us to continue striving to Keep India Smiling.Issam BachaalaniManaging DirectorColgate-Palmolive (India) LimitedDIN: 06975320* Prior period numbers restated for GST impact, for comparison purposes.

Management Discussion and Analysis Report(within the limits set by the Company’s competitive position)
Appendix

Our Company operates in the Personal Care business, which accounts for more than 50% of FMCG sales in India. This includes Oral Care that contributes over 90% of  the  Company’s  sales  turnover.  Within Oral Care, the Company continues to sustain the leadership position both in the Toothpaste and Toothbrush categories for the year ended March 31, 2019 despite challenging business and competitive environment.As a leading consumer products company, we are also deeply committed to advancing  technology  that can address changing consumer needs. This is consistent with our Company’s sustained endeavour which is to leverage technology to create products that will improve the quality of life for our consumers.The Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in its key products categories. On an on- going  basis,  management  focuses  on  a  variety  of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, net sales, gross profit margin, operating profit and net profit after tax, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company’s Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls.To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on the introduction of innovative products and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the launch of successful new products.In line with our focus on evolving consumer demands our company had major launches/re-launches in the portfolio, including-Colgate Strong Teeth: Colgate’s best-selling toothpaste brand in India has been re-launched on an evocative platform of ‘‘Daant Banaye Andar se Strong” - Strengthens Teeth from within. Refreshed with a new packaging and on-pack messaging, the
re-launch of Colgate Strong Teeth is strategically aimed at resonating with the virtues of being strong from within.Colgate Total: Colgate Total  was re-launched with  a new advanced formula that provides superior protection for problem-causing germs not just for your teeth but also for your tongue, cheeks and gums. The advanced formula contains Dual Zinc and Arginine, which help fight germs, food acids and stains to give you Whole Mouth Health.New Motu Patlu & Colgate Kids Toothpaste Variant: Strengthening Colgate’s existing Kids toothpaste portfolio, which is built around exciting characters like Spiderman, Barbie and Minions, Colgate launched themed toothpaste – Motu Patlu with Fun & Fruity flavours for children which is sure to resonate with Indian consumers.SuperFlexi Sensitive Toothbrush: The latest addition to the toothbrush portfolio is SuperFlexi Sensitive toothbrush. This has premium ultrasoft bristles and a flexible neck handle to ensure complete yet gentle cleaning for sensitive teeth & gums. It also comes in a first-ever premium window hanger to stand out in-store.Palmolive Facial Bar: Launched in select markets of Kerala and Delhi, Palmolive Facial Bar has been developed with nature’s goodness and Palmolive’s expertise, in 3 exciting variants – Vitamin C&E, Turmeric & Tamarind, and Charcoal. Its unique formula, enriched with fruit oil & natural extracts creates luxurious foam on usage, cleansing the skin from deep within to make it healthy and radiant.Above launches were complemented by our existing best-in-class distribution network across the country through many distributors who were our pillars for many years including challenging times. This long term association and the trust that was built over the years helped our company increase the stores that we directly distributed our products to an unprecedented level of +30% on an existing strong reach in a short span of time. Trust is the foundation of our company’s partnership which helps us collaborate with key customers in Modern Trade and e-commerce. Our company, in line with its reputation in the industry, has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships

with consumers, dental professionals and customers. With increased focus, the Company has strengthened its capabilities in e-commerce, including developing its relationships with online-only retailers and enhancing its digital marketing capabilities.As a testament to the above, Colgate ranked as India’s #1 Most Trusted Oral Care Brand as per India’s Most Trusted Brands Survey 2018, conducted by Nielsen and commissioned by Economic Times - Brand Equity.The investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce  costs  associated  with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range  of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification.In India, almost one-third of the population does not have access to modern oral care. With its market leadership in the Oral Care category, there is an enormous opportunity for the Company to expand its business as oral care habits improve. We had initiated many activities in 2018 including our Colgate’s ‘Kumbh Se Sampoorna Shuddhi, Colgate Vedshakti Se Sampoorna Suraksha’ campaignColgate had endeavoured to ensure complete protection or ‘sampoorna suraksha’ of the pilgrims  at Kumbh Mela, which is the world’s largest human congregation, where more than 15 crore people come for a holy dip in the Prayag, at Allahabad. The main aim of the said campaign was to create oral hygiene awareness and also ensure a safe visit for all pilgrims.This completely localised campaign was custom- made to provide a complete all-around protection to pilgrims through a range of Kumbh specific activities and utility elements such as:? Brushing stations for pilgrims to brush their teeth;? Oral care importance drives to spread the awareness of good oral hygiene;? 
A free, large-scale sampling of Colgate Vedshakti for millions of people at Kumbh;? Suraksha Wristbands for children to write/wear their emergency contact details on a safety wristband; and? Sampoorna Suraksha Ropes given to big groups and families to hold on to, to ensure that they walk together without getting lost in the crowd.In recent years, the Company has experienced heightened competitive activity, particularly within the Naturals segment. Such activity includes aggressive marketing claims, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic/distribution expansion. In addition, while the Company is focused on growing in its other Personal Care categories, due to the high concentration of the Company’s business in Oral Care, the Company could be significantly impacted by any major disruption in the Oral Care category.Looking forward, the Company expects challenging market conditions and favourable macro economic conditions to continue. The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating  in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s key priorities: continuous investment behind brands, growing sales through engaging with consumers, delivering world-class innovation and working with its distributors and retail partners; driving efficiency on every line of the income statement to increase margins; generating strong cash flow performance and utilizing that cash effectively to enhance total shareholder returns; and leading to win by staying true to the Company’s culture and focusing on its stakeholders. The  Company’s  commitment  to these priorities, together with the strength of the Company’s brands, its best-in-class distribution network and its cost-saving initiatives, should position the Company well to increase stakeholder value over the long term.The Company believes that adequate internal  control systems are in place. The  discussion  on  the Company’s financial performance, including segment-wise performance, is covered in the Board’s Report. There were no material developments on human resources during the financial year 2018-19 and industrial relations continue to be positive. The number of people employed by the Company as on March 31, 2019 was 2,305.

1. Colgate Bright Smiles, Bright Futures™ Program:At Colgate, we understand that oral health plays a significant role in people’s overall health. Thus we recognize the importance of a healthy smile and following continued good oral health care practices. Importantly, developing good habits at an early age helps children get a good start towards a lifetime of oral health.As India’s leader in oral care, Colgate is committed to improving children’s oral health and considers it as the Company’s responsibility to bring healthy,  bright smiles to the children  of India through oral health awareness and education.One of the most impactful oral health initiatives by Colgate is Bright Smiles, Bright Futures™ (BSBF). A flagship initiative by the Company, it was created with an aim to spread awareness among children about the correct oral health habits, basic hygiene and diet and reduce the prevalence of dental caries. Since the inception of the program in 1976, the Company has been delivering oral health education to children by reaching out to influencers – like school teachers and the anganwadi workers in the community to promote preventive oral care education.Children between the age group of 6 to 14 years studying in primary schools are taught good oral hygiene habits, the right techniques of brushing with the use of a tooth model and a toothbrush, and the importance of brushing at night through an interactive module, where the importance   of a good mouth cleaning regimen is strongly instilled in them. At the end of the program, each child is given a ‘Dental Health Pack’ consisting of a toothpaste and a toothbrush, along with attractive charts depicting valuable oral care information in order to encourage these children to brush twice a day and take care of their oral care hygiene. A chart containing oral care information is left in each classroom as a reminder to the children, and for the teachers to reiterate the oral care message. School teachers are trained and provided with a ‘Teacher’s Guide’ to help them instill good oral care habits on an on-going basis. The Teacher’s Guide is a detailed booklet that pictorially provides the details of a tooth’s anatomy and the different stages of decay, and the causes of gum diseases, to help teachers advocate the importance of healthy teeth.
As a pilot in the year 2017-18, along with the preventive oral health awareness for children, dental checkups were added in the ongoing BSBF program in two cities, predominantly in the government or municipal schools. This pilot program was successfully implemented for approximately 2.5 million children. We aim to continue to scale this initiative in the future too.BSBF has, so far, touched the lives of 162 million plus children between the ages of 6 and 14 years in schools across India since inception of the program.In the financial year 2018-19 alone, the BSBF program reached 11.5 million children across the country with oral health awareness and education.2. Oral Health Month:India’s first National Oral Health Survey, which was conducted by the Dental Council of India and the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, focused on improving the standards of oral health care in India. Colgate, along with Indian Dental Association (IDA), rolled out Oral Health Month (OHM) in 2004 as a 6-city program with 70 participating dentists. Spanning two months every year, OHM promotes  oral  health  care by offering free, preventive dental check-ups across the country.The program was further strengthened with the introduction of mobile vans to service under- privileged areas. OHM has also made oral care check-ups more accessible to people, and also helps to address any in-clinic fears that people may harbor.This oral care health drive now encompasses free in-clinic dental check-ups, school contact programs, free dental check-ups in mobile dental vans, a retailer outreach program and other community outreach initiatives. In the past 13 years, OHM has grown phenomenally, emerging as a leading campaign for promoting oral health care  in  India.  In  the  financial  year 2018-19, in the months of November to January, almost 35,000 dentists participated in the program across India. In our estimate, this campaign benefited almost 6 million people across the country, contributing actively towards improving oral health care in India in the financial year 2018-19.

3. A Positive Step Program with Network in Thane by People Living with HIV (NTP+):At Colgate, we recognize the seriousness of HIV/ AIDS and its overall impact on the workplace and on the society. Our HR policy focuses on non- discrimination and confidentiality, prevention, access to treatment, partnerships with third parties and providing proactive organizational support. We work to limit the impact of HIV/AIDS and maintain an environment at Colgate that is open and conducive to acceptance.Colgate initiated ‘A Positive Step’, a program in collaboration with ‘Network In Thane By People Living With HIV’ (NTP+), a non-governmental organization promoting education for the HIV infected and affected children.The program  supports  education,  nutrition and the overall personality grooming of the infected and affected children with the help of NGO partners. The program that had started with a handful of children has grown to support approximately 90+ children now.In  the  financial   year   2017-18, the focus  was on computer literacy and personality development programs for these infected and affected children who form a part of the Positive Step Program. Based on their need assessment the Knowledge Garden initiative (a creative library) was introduced to the program. The Knowledge Garden initiative has encouraged and helped children develop a desire to learn through creative ways. Colgate employee volunteers spend their time in engaging with these children through creative and fun based learning sessions which has helped these children sharpen their skills and given them the confidence to face challenges bravely and more positively. In the financial year 2018-19, we took another step in the Knowledge Garden initiative and launched a Mentorship program for senior children, who aspire to choose their career path. The mentorship programs aim to enable these young, aspiring children with better guidance.Every year, Colgate also organizes a special event on ‘World AIDS Day’, wherein these children are invited to spend a day at the Colgate office and interact with their sponsors, volunteers, and with the entire Colgate family. This occasion is also a platform for the children to showcase their talents and for Colgate People to salute their spirit. More information about the NGO is available on https://ntpplus.org4. 
Programs with Seva Mandir:Seva Mandir is a non-profit organization, working in and around Udaipur, in Rajasthan. It works in the fields of education, health, empowerment  of women and youth, village institutions and towards natural resource development.Our association with Seva Mandir has supported programs in various domains like education for children, women empowerment and conservation of natural resources for the marginalized communities in the rural and tribal areas of Udaipur, Rajasthan.‘Colgate Seva Mandir Education Scholarship Program’ was launched in financial year 2017-18 for  children  from  tribal  and  rural  areas  of Rajasthan. The children enrolled in this program are primarily girls from less privileged families. Colgate supports the entire program cost including children’s school fees, hostel stay, cost for study material, uniforms, travel, special coaching, remedial classes and other support. Children study in Vidya Bhawan School in Udaipur, which focuses on an all-round development of children through academics, sports and also by building in them a strong value system, through various engaging activities and initiatives. The academic scores of the sponsored children have progressed a lot as compared to their baseline assessment scores. In addition, with a focus on sports and fitness, few girls in the program have also qualified for District and State level Hockey tournaments.Colgate has also supported Seva Mandir and Vidya Bhawan to build a better infrastructure and facilities for the children in the form of well- lit classrooms, uniforms, residential and storage spaces, availability of safe drinking water, renovation of toilets and washing facilities, availability  of  computers  and  infrastructure for libraries, creation of a Volley ball court and common areas in some of its two hostels. The aim of the program is to support the accessibility to quality education, sports and build an overall, enriching experience for the children and to enable them to aspire for a brighter future ahead.In the financial year 2017-18, Colgate partnered with Seva Mandir to design and support the Women Empowerment program through livelihood activities like backyard poultry, Floriculture and Water augmentation.

This  program  focuses  on  the  economic   and social empowerment of communities, specifically of  women  from  9  tribal  villages  in Udaipur, Rajasthan. The structure of the program has multiple dimensions like formation and strengthening of women self-help groups, technical trainings for vaccinations, floriculture, and various other collaborations. The program was launched formally in the financial year 2018-19 in one of the tribal village of Alsigarh block, Udaipur, Rajasthan.The initial results of the program are encouraging and the beneficiaries have started generating income. 178 women beneficiaries and their families have been directly benefited through floriculture or backyard poultry or both and about 3000 villagers have benefited directly or indirectly through water augmentation work. We have planned additional interventions to strengthen the program. We aim to continue to empower women and communities of tribal and rural areas to enhance their economic and social well-being and to enable them to look forward to a better future for themselves and their families.Colgate employees volunteer and partner with Seva Mandir to support these causes through various volunteering initiatives. More information about the NGO is available on www.sevamandir. org5. Read India with Pratham:Colgate has been associated  with  Pratham, an NGO working towards providing quality education to the underprivileged children in India. ‘Every child in school and learning well’, has been Pratham’s endeavor since its modest beginnings in Mumbai in 1994. Pratham tries  to supplement the Government initiatives of primary education.Colgate has partnered with Pratham under  their initiative “Read India”. Under this initiative Colgate extends its support to educate 10 communities in Mumbai. Employee volunteers engage with the children in these communities through learning camps and help them learn language, skills, etc. More information about the NGO is available on www.pratham.org.6. ‘Saksham’ Program with SEEDS:Realizing the need to make the future generation more employable and self-reliant, Colgate
launched ‘Saksham’, a pragmatic initiative for the social and economic empowerment of the youth from lesser privileged backgrounds, through employability linked skill development program. Colgate launched this program in 2016 in partnership with NGO SEEDS and its implementation partner IL&FS Skills.Through an extensive mobilization process, candidates from rural and urban clusters are enrolled for the program. The focus is on enrolling candidates who have the potential and willingness to learn, but may be lacking the financial resources, exposure and guidance. The curriculum is imparted through multimedia enabled content, by trained faculty Members. Efforts are made to arrange opportunities for experiential learning through interactions, engaging sessions and visits from Colgate teams and other people from different walks of life, including business partners, etc. This helps to build the confidence of the candidates.The ‘Saksham’ journey started with an enrolment of 55 candidates at Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. The program has now expanded to Kanpur, Varanasi, Allahabad, Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh, Patna in Bihar and Kolkata in West Bengal. Till March 2019, more than 900 candidates have been trained and certified and 650 candidates have been facilitated with employment opportunities through the NGO and its implementation partner and rest are undergoing the process. More information about the NGO is available on www.seedsimpact.org7. Water with ‘Water for People, India Trust:Water is one of the key pillars of Colgate’s sustainability initiatives. To build a culture of Save Water many initiatives have been carried out within Colgate’s manufacturing facilities and offices across India, which have helped not only in the recycling, reuse, and zero discharge of water but also in water conservation and sensitization towards the cause of Save Water.To strengthen our commitment towards water and to support communities, Colgate has expanded its partnership with Water for People, India Trust (an NGO) and launched Water program for rural and tribal villages of district Amravati in Maharashtra. Water for People India Trust focuses on comprehensive water management approach.

In Amravati district, an in-depth feasibility assessment was conducted to shortlist the villages which have multiple challenges with respect to water. The level of water in the local water source starts depleting from the month  of February, due to which the women and girls of the local communities have to fetch water from distant water sources. Additionally, other challenges like water quality and accessibility need redressal too. A comprehensive roadmap and implementation plan is made to address these challenges in the select villages based on need prioritization, etc.The program aims to support a projected cumulative coverage of approximately 36 villages over the next 3 years from now. The key components of this program are: water availability, accessibility, quality of water, rain water harvesting and support in sanitation (in schools/communities area as per plan) and education on hygiene and conservation of water through the WASH program based prioritization, sustainability, partnership of local communities and stakeholders and building capacities. The work has started in 10 villages and we aim to implement program as per roadmap in these8. 
Education Program with Action Aid:This program aims to impact the lives of the children from low income group families by empowering them with computer-literacy, communication skills and personality grooming. Efforts are made to encourage enrolment  of girl children in the program. The program has started in villages in and around Baddi, Himachal Pradesh.As per assessment, it was found that inspite of an interest and the potential to learn, children from  villages  and  less  privileged  families  are not well versed with computers and lack communication skills. In the initial phase, approximately 500 children will be taken into the program through a mixed model of community center school and government schools. The program will also help to sensitize communities and engage employees and other stakeholders through volunteering and other opportunities. More information about the NGO is available on www.actionaidindia.org.On behalf of the Board

CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, TECHNOLOGY ABSORPTION AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS AND OUTGO PURSUANT TO PROVISIONS OF SECTION 134 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013 READ WITH THE COMPANIES (ACCOUNTS) RULES, 2014.A) Conservation of Energy and Water:Your Company continues its endeavor to improve energy & water conservation and utilization. Some of the steps taken by the Company for conservation of energy & water  at its manufacturing plants during the financial year 2018-19 are outlined below:Sanand Plant• Conservation of Energy:- At regular intervals Plant conducts a workshop viz. ‘Energy Treasure Hunt’ to encourage ideas on energy conservation from its employees. The ideas generated for energy conservation are being implemented, which has generated saving of 13% on per MT of production, quantifies to 25.3 Lakhs kWh of electricity saving    in 2018.Further, during the financial year 2018-19 plant had invested ` 82  Lakhs on identified projects which will save additional 6 Lakhs kWh of electricity on an annual basis.• Conservation of Water:- Last year Plant had harvested about 46,694 Cubic Meters (Cu M) of rain water, based on 2018 rainfall data. Further,  Plant reuses waste water after treating it in Effluent Treatment Plant for gardening. Last year, the plant had used 35,161 Cu M of treated water. In total the Plant had saved 81,855 Cu M of water which is more than the water consumed by site (77,198 Cu M) from GIDC.- Plant had also conducted a water workshop viz. ‘Water Treasure Hunt’ to explore water conservation ideas amongst employees. During the year many water saving projects were implemented which resulted in saving of about 18% on per MT of production which quantifies to 8,023 Cu M of water saving.
Goa Plant• Conservation of Energy:- Installed seven Dust Extraction System with high efficiency blower motors (IE3) controlled by VFDs to regulate the speed automatically, thus saving power in abrasive loading area.- CFL lights are replaced with LED Lamps in flex making floor of the plant. This has reduced the making lighting  load  by  50% and overall reduced the lighting load.• Conservation of Water:- Conservation of around 1,800 KL rain water was recharged to ground.- Site explored use of Gamma Jet Spray ball which reduces consumption of water in manufacturing equipment during cleaning and sanitization process.- Water sprinklers were added in main lawn to optimize water consumption.Plant added new AHU Condensate Recovery line to the utility cooling towers thereby saving upto 3-5 KL of water per day depending on the season.Baddi Plant• Conservation of Energy:- Installed the VFD and pressure transducer on 35 KL (utility) Tank Motor and interlocked it with the Line Pressure. The pump now delivers only required volumes to utility equipments like boilers, cooling towers, chillers etc., resulting in reduced operational time of the pump.- Secondary water system and 66 KV Lights interlocked with motion sensor.- Making system’s Local CIP Pump interlocked with SCADA and enabled time settings for the operations resulting in energy conservation.• Conservation of Water:- Cooling tower make up water reduction by optimizing the TDS (using RO water low TDS mixing with raw water) which has resulted around savings of 20,000 Ltrs of water per month.

- The reuse of chlorine sensor circulation water as raw water for the utilities purpose, had reduced the overall ground water consumption by 25,000 Ltrs per month and also the load on the Effluent Treatment Plant.- Vacuum Pump water reduction by 25,000 Ltrs per month after doing  modification on the cooling circuits of all the vacuum pumps being used for the mixers.- Making system’s Local CIP Pump interlocked with Timer which has resulted in reduction of water consumption by 50,000 Ltrs per month.- Reuse of Back wash water of MGF after filtration as raw water in the utility RO system which has resulted  in  reduction of water consumption from bore wells by 1,00,000 Ltrs per month.Sricity Plant• Conservation of Energy :- The Company has taken many initiatives in the Plant, majorly by investing in Solar Power plant of 1,284 KW capacity for captive consumption to ensure commitment towards green power, sustainability and saving initiatives. Many other initiatives were also taken in driving the productivity, process, utilities and ancillary equipment changes which delivered reduction in energy index over 20 %.- Installation and commissioning of 1,284KW Solar Power in the plant achieved an annual savings of 1,872 MWh.- Implementation of Common Dust extraction system for 10 End rounding machines by inter-connecting 2 machines’ dust extraction to One Dust collector. This initiative has helped to achieve an annual savings of about 134 MWh.- Arresting of Air leakages in machines by conducting external Air Audit and identified 179 air leaks and resulted annual savings of 196 MWh.- By inter-connecting Chilled water lines of 2 Vertical Injection moulding machines had helped to reduce 1 MTC instead of 2 MTC. This initiative has helped to achieve an annual savings of about 179 MWh.- 
Time based scheduling of Ventilation system in locker room resulted annual savings of 59 MWh from 5 Ventilation fans.- Through optimization of continuous running of AHUs’ with 50 Hz frequency was reduced to 35 & 40 Hz in 2 AHUs’ which resulted annual savings of 14 MWh.- Three Solar Street lights installed near Solar plant which is saving of 0.7MWh• Conservation of Water:- Level sensors fixed in cooling towers to avoid water overflow from 850TR & 350TR Cooling towers- Waterless urinals were installed to save 24 KL water and planned to install in all our Urinals in 2019 which will save around 750 KL.- Reduction in evaporated water from cooling towers by reducing the fan frequency from 50 Hz to 15 Hz, This resulted in reduction of Power consumption and also saving of Water evaporation- Implemented quality based back wash instead of time based which resulted in annual savings of 120KL.B.

issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Ind AS financial statements.Key Audit MattersKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Ind AS financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Ind AS financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the  Ind AS financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Ind AS financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying Ind AS financial statements.
(a)Revenue Recognition (as described in note 26 of the financial statements)Revenue from the sale of goods is measured net off discounts and rebates that are given to the customers (i.e. to the Wholesale traders and Retail traders) as a part of sales promotion, comprising of primary and secondary schemes.Of the total discounts and rebates passed on to the customers, certain discounts and rebates are passed on to the customers only on secondary sale made by wholesale trader to retail trader i.e., secondary schemes.Recognition of estimated accruals relating to secondary schemes requires judgement, based on sales made during the year.We have performed the following audit procedures:?

Other InformationThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual report but does not include the Ind AS financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.Our opinion on the Ind AS financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.In connection with our audit of the Ind AS financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial  statements  or  our  knowledge  obtained  in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.Responsibilities of Management for the Ind AS Financial StatementsThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted
in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2018. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and  prudent;  and the design, implementation  and  maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the  accounting  records,  relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the Ind AS financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.Those  Board  of  Directors  are  also  responsible  for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Ind AS Financial StatementsOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Ind AS financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Ind AS financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required  to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are  based  on  the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure  and content of the Ind AS financial statements, including the disclosures, and  whether  the  Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence,  and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Ind AS financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2019 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements1.

ANNEXURE II TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF COLGATE-PALMOLIVE (INDIA) LIMITEDReport on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2019 in conjunction with our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial ControlsThe Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to  the  Company’s  policies,  the  safeguarding  of  its assets, the prevention and detection of  frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.Auditor’s ResponsibilityOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that  we  comply  with ethical requirements and plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements.Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with Reference to these Financial StatementsA company’s internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting With Reference to these Financial StatementsBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
OpinionIn our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements and such internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2019, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.For S R B C & CO LLPChartered AccountantsICAI Firm Registration Number: 324982E/E300003per Jayesh GandhiPartnerMembership Number: 037924Place of Signature: Mumbai Date: May 27, 2019

1A. Background:Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited is a subsidiary of Colgate-Palmolive, USA and a listed Company in India. The Company was incorporated on September 23, 1937 under the provisions of The Companies Act. The registered office of the company is located at Colgate Research Center, Main street, Hiranandani Gardens, Powai, Mumbai – 400076. Its shares are listed on two recognised stock exchanges in India. The Company is engaged in manufacturing/ trading of toothpaste, tooth powder, toothbrush, mouth wash and personal care products.These financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2019 were approved by the Board of Directors on May 27, 2019.1B. Significant Accounting Policies:The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.(a) Basis of preparationi. Compliance with Ind ASThe financial statements comply in all material aspects with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) [Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] (as amended from time to time) and other relevant provisions of the Act.ii. Historical Cost ConventionThese financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below:• Certain financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value;• Defined Benefit Plans - plan assets measured at fair value;• Share-Based payments; and• Assets held for sale – measured at lower of cost and fair value less costs to selliii. 
Current	versus	Non-currentclassificationThe Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classification. An asset is treated as current when it is:• Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle• Held primarily for the purpose of trading• Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or• Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting periodAll other assets are classified as non- current.A liability is current when:• It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle• It is held primarily for the purpose of trading• It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or• There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting periodThe Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.Based on the nature of  products  and  the  time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose of current / non-current classification of assets and liabilities.

(b) Foreign currency translationi. Functional and presentation currencyItems included in the financial statements of the Company  are  measured  using  the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The financial statements are presented in Indian currency (INR), which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.ii. Transactions and balancesForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange  rates  at  the  dates of  the  transactions.   Realised   gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency  transactions  are   recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the year-end are translated at the year-end exchange rates, and the  resultant  exchange  difference  is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Non-monetary foreign currency items are carried at cost.(c) Property, plant and equipmentProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation and impairment loss, if any. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of  the  items including capital spares which are identified as a part of property, plant and equipment .Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or  recognised  as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.Capital Work-In-ProgressCost and direct expenses incurred for construction of assets or assets to be acquired, which are not ready to use in the manner intended by the management are disclosed under capital work in progress.Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual valueThe useful lives of the assets are based on  technical  estimates  approved  by  the Management,  and  are  lower  than  or same as the useful lives prescribed under schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 in order to reflect the period over which depreciable assets  are  expected to be used by the Company. Depreciation is calculated on a pro-rata basis on the straight line method so as to write-down the cost of property, plant and equipment to its residual value systematically over its estimated useful life based on useful life of the assets as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 except in case of following assets, wherein based on internal assessment and technical evaluation, a different useful life has been determined.Asset Class	Useful Life Residential and Office Buildings 40 years Factory Buildings		20 years
can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance
Plant and Equipment (Including Finance lease)Dies and Moulds (included in Plant and Equipment)

are charged to the Statement of Profit and

Office Equipment (including Computer Servers)
5 years

Estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed annually, taking into account commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.(d) LeasesAs a LesseeLeases of property, plant and equipment where the Company, as lessee, has substantially all the  risks  and  rewards  of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding rental  obligations,  net of finance charges, are included in borrowings or other  financial  liabilities  as appropriate. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Company as lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless the payments are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases.(e) Investment propertyProperty that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the Company, is classified as investment property. Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred.Investment properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which is 40 years.Though the Company measures investment property using cost based measurement, the fair value of investment property is disclosed in the notes. Fair values are determined based on an annual evaluation performed by an accredited external independent valuer.Investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit or loss in the period of derecognition.(f) Intangible assetsIntangible Assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss, if any.AmortisationIntangible assets comprise of Goodwill, Trademarks, Copyright and Technical Know-how. Intangible assets (other than Goodwill) are amortised over the useful life of assets, not exceeding 10 years.The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period,  with  the  effect of any changes in the estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.Expenditure on research is  recognized  as an expense when it is incurred. Development costs of products are also charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss

unless all the criteria for capitalization have been met by the Company. Development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an intangible asset when the Company can demonstrate:• The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale• Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to use or sell the asset• How the asset will generate future economic benefits• The availability of resources to complete the asset• The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development(g) Impairment of non-financial assetsAt each balance sheet date, the Company reviews whether there is an indication  that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, the company estimates the recoverable amount of its asset’s other than inventory and deferred tax. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined as higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating unit). Assessment is done at each Balance Sheet date as to whether there  is any indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset in prior accounting period may no longer exist or may have decreased. An impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had previously been recognised.(h) InventoriesInventories of raw and packing materials, stores, work-in-progress, finished goods
and stock in trade are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value.- Cost is determined using standard cost method that approximates actual cost.- Cost of work-in-progress and finished goods includes materials, labour and manufacturing overheads and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.Spares that do not qualify to be recognized as Property, Plant and equipment are included in stores and spares.Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.(i) Trade ReceivablesTrade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost net of any expected credit losses, if any. The  Company  provides  for expected credit losses based on the probability of defaults that are possible over the life of the asset.(j) Cash and Cash equivalentsFor the purpose of presentation in the Statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, demand deposits with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less  that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.(k) Assets held for saleAssets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, a  sale is considered highly probable and is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the

date of classification. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits financial assets and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.An impairment loss is  recognised  for  any initial or subsequent write-down  of the asset to fair value less costs to sell.   A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell   of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised.A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of de-recognition.Assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of assets held for sale continue to be recognized.Assets classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet under “Other Current Assets”. The liabilities for assets held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet.(l) Financial Assets:i. Initial recognition and measurementAll financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset, except in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss. Transaction  costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed through the Statement of Profit and Loss.ii. Subsequent measurementFor purposes of subsequent measurement, the Company classifies its financial assets
in the following measurement categories:• those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and• those measured at amortised cost.The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in Statement of Profit and Loss or other comprehensive income. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held. For investments   in equity instruments, this  will  depend  on whether the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income.Debt instrumentsSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company’s business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Company classifies its debt instruments:Amortised costAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows  where  those  cash flows  represent  solely  payments  of principal and interest  are  measured  at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a  debt investment that is subsequently measured at amortised cost is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.

Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and  for  selling  the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in Statement of  Profit  and Loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to Statement of Profit and Loss. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method.Fair value through Profit or Loss(FVTPL)Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured  at fair value through profit or  loss.  A  gain or loss  on  a  debt  investment  that is subsequently measured at fair value through Profit or Loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which it arises. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income.iii. DerecognitionA financial asset is derecognised only when:• the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired, or• the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows to one or more recipientWhere the entity has transferred  an asset, the  Company  evaluates  whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial
asset. In such cases, the financial asset  is derecognised. Where the entity  has  not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognised.Where the entity has neither transferred  a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards  of  ownership  of  the financial  asset,  the  financial  asset  is derecognised if the company has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Company retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset. Expected credit losses are recognized for all financial assets subsequent to initial recognition.(m) Financial Liabilitiesi. Classification as liability or equityFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.ii. Initial recognition and measurementFinancial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are initially measured at the amortised cost unless at initial recognition, they are classified as fair value through profit or loss.iii. Subsequent measurementFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.iv. DerecognitionA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.

Trade and other payablesThese amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of financial year which are unpaid. The amounts are usually unsecured. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within twelve months after the reporting period. They are recognised initially at their fair value.ProvisionsThe Company recognises a provision when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as result of a past event that probably requires an outflow of resources and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.Contingent LiabilityA disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or     a present obligation that  the  likelihood  of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.(n) Revenue from contract with customeri. Sale of goodsThe Company’s revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation to sell its products to trade customers. Sales are recorded at  the  time  control  of the products is transferred to trade
customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products. Control is the ability of trade customers   to direct the use of and obtain the benefit from our products. In evaluating the timing of the transfer of control of products to trade customers, the Company considers transfer of significant risks and rewards of products and the probability of flowing of future economic benefit to the Entity as per the terms of the Contract which usually co- incide with the delivery of the goods.Sales are recognized at the fair value of the consideration that can be reliably measured reduced by variable consideration. Variable consideration includes sales returns, trade discounts, volume based incentives, cost of promotional programs, indirect taxes as may be applicable.The Company provides volume based incentives to certain customers once the quantity of products purchased  during  the period exceeds a threshold specified in the contract. Incentives are offset against amounts payable by the customer. To estimate & recognize a  liability  for  the incentives, the Company applies methods which best predicts the amount of incentive and is primarily driven by the number of volume thresholds  contained in  the  contract.  The  volume  incentive  is estimated at contract inception and recognized when it is highly probable that significant revenue reversal will not occur.Company’s contracts with trade customers do not have significant financing components or non cash consideration and the Company does not have unbilled revenue or significant amounts of prepayments from customers.The company pays sales commission to its employees for contract that they obtain for sales of goods and immediately expensed out sales commissions (included under employee benefits).

Contract balances Contract liabilitiesA  contract  liability   is   the   obligation   to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer.  If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company performs its obligation to transfer goods or services under the contract.Trade receivablesRefer to Note (i) under Significant Accounting Policies.ii. Service IncomeService Income is recognised on cost plus basis as per the terms of the contract with customers, as and when the service is performed.iii. Interest incomeInterest income  from  debt  instruments  is recognised using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider the expected credit losses.iv. Rental incomeRental income from operating leases where the Company is a lessor is recognised in income on a  straight-line  basis   over  the lease term unless the receipts are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the expected inflationary cost increases. The
respective leased assets are included in the balance sheet based on their nature.(o) Employee Benefitsi. Short Term Employee BenefitsLiabilities for salaries, wages and performance incentives including non- monetary benefits that are expected  to be settled wholly within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employees render the  related  service are recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented as current employee benefits obligations in the Balance Sheet.ii. Long term employee Benefits• Defined Contribution PlansProvident Fund, Superannuation Fund and Employee’s State Insurance:The Company has Defined Contribution Plans for its employees such as Provident Fund, Superannuation Fund, Employee’s State Insurance etc. and contribution to these plans are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred, as the Company has no further obligation beyond making the contributions.• Defined Benefit PlansGratuity:The  Company   provides   for   gratuity,   a defined benefit plan (the  “Gratuity Plan”) covering eligible employees in accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment.  The Company’s liability is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit Credit method) at the end of each year. The benefits are discounted using the

market yields at the end of the reporting period that  have  terms  approximating  to the terms of the related obligation. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur directly in other comprehensive income.  They are included in retained earnings in the Statement of changes in Equity and in the Balance Sheet. Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments are recognised immediately in the Statement of profit and loss as past service cost. Remeasurments are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.Provident Fund:In respect of certain employees, Provident Fund contributions are made to a Trust administered by the Company. The interest rate payable by the trust to the beneficiaries every year is  notified  by  the Government. The Company has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investment of the trust and interest as per the notified rate. The Company’s liability is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit Credit Method) at the end of the year. Measurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur directly in other comprehensive income.  They are included in retained earnings in the Statement of changes in Equity and in the Balance Sheet. Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or
curtailments are recognised immediately in the Statement of profit and loss as past service cost. Remeasurments are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.Pension:The Company provides for retirement/post- retirement benefits for certain employees in the form of Pension (Non-funded) which are in the nature of Defined Benefit Plans. Such benefits are provided for on the basis of an independent actuarial valuation done at the year-end using Projected Unit Credit Method. Measurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the Statement of changes in Equity and  in the Balance Sheet. Remeasurments are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.• Compensated Absences:Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to be availed or encashed within  12 months from the end  of the year and are treated as short term employee benefits. The obligation towards the same is measured at the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount expected to be paid as a result of the unused entitlement as at the year end.Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to be availed or encashed beyond 12 months from the end of the year end are treated as other long term employee benefits. The Company’s liability is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit Credit method) at the end of each year. Actuarial losses/gains are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise.

• Voluntary Retirement Scheme:Expenditure on voluntary retirement scheme  is  charged  to  the  Statement  of Profit and Loss in the year in which incurred.iii. Share based PaymentsThe Company does not provide any equity- based compensation to its employees. However, the parent Company, Colgate Palmolive Company, U.S.A. (“the grantor”) maintains equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of stock-based awards to its executive directors and certain categories of officers and employees. The 2009 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan and 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan (“Incentive Plan”) provides for the grant of non-qualified and  incentive  stock options, as well as restricted stock units which are together referred to as employee stock options. Exercise prices in the case of non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock of the grantor on the date of grant.A stock option gives an employee, the right to purchase shares of Colgate Palmolive Company common stock at a fixed price for a specific period of time. Stock options generally have a term of six years and vest over three years.A restricted stock unit  (RSU)  provides  an employee with a share of Colgate Palmolive Company common stock upon vesting. Restricted stock units vest in annual installments generally over a period of three years. Dividends will accrue with each restricted stock unit award granted subsequent to grant date.Employee Stock Options (ESOPs’) issued by the parent entity are  accounted  for  as equity-settled as the  Company  has  no obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction and also the shares are of parent Company.Company recognises the expense over the vesting period, which is the period over
which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied,  as  determined  on  the grant date, based on the fair value    of the options/RSUs. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting and service conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Statement of Profit and Loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.In case where there is a clear link between the recharge from the parent company and the expense, Company will account the recharge as capital  distribution even if the amount of recharge is more than  the expense recognised over the vesting period (as the recharge is based on the intrinsic value).In case where the employee has not served the Company during the vesting period and for which they get the debit note from parent, the cost will be debited to management recharge expense.Further, where the management recharge is not expected from the parent entity as the employee has been relocated to another group company i.e. the employee is not expected to render future services to the Company at the time of exercise of option, the Company transfers the proportionate amount of share options outstanding account related to such employees to Retained Earnings, after taking into consideration the probability of employees re-locating back to the Company.(p) Income TaxTax expense for the period, comprising current tax and deferred tax, are included in the determination of the net profit or loss for the period. Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with prevailing income tax law.• Current TaxCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a

legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there  is an intention to settle the  asset and the liability on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and deferred  tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off assets against liabilities representing current tax and where the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to taxes on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.• Deferred TaxDeferred tax is recognised for all the deductible temporary differences by using the liability method, only to  the extent that there is a reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively  enacted  by the Balance Sheet date. At each Balance Sheet date, the Company reassesses unrecognised deferred tax assets, if any.Deferred tax relating to items recognised  outside  profit  or  loss  is recognised either in other comprehensive income or in equity. Deferred tax items are  recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.  Unrecognised  deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are  recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered(q) Segment ReportingOperating  segments   are   reported   in   a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker (“CODM”). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Managing Director and Finance Director of the Company. The Company has identified ‘Personal Care (including Oral Care)’ as its only primary reportable segment, which primarily includes products such as Soaps, Cosmetics and Toilet Preparations.(r) Cash Flow StatementCash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit before tax is adjusted for the effects  of  transactions  of non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments.(s) Offsetting Financial InstrumentsFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.(t) Contributed EquityOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.(u) Earnings Per sharei. Basic Earnings per ShareBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:• the profit attributable to owners of theCompany• by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in equity shares issued during the year.

ii. Diluted Earnings per shareDiluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account:• the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential equity shares, and• the weighted average number of additional equity shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.2. Critical accounting estimates and judgmentsThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal the actual results. This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgment or complexity, and of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgments is included in relevant notes together with information  about  the  basis  of   calculation for each affected line item in the financial statements.The areas involving critical estimates or judgments are:- Estimation of defined benefit obligation (Note 29)- Estimation of Useful life of Property, plant and equipment and intangibles (Note 3)- Estimation of taxes (Note 20 and 32)- Estimation	of	impairment	of	trade receivables (Note 9)- Estimation of provision and contingent liabilities (Note 25 and 33)- Estimation of Share based payments to employees (Note 38)- 
Estimation of variable consideration in respect of revenue recognition (Refer Note 1B(n) and Note 26)Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future  events  that  may  have a financial impact on the Company and that  are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.2A. Recent accounting pronouncements: Standards issued but not yet effective Ind AS 116 LeasesInd AS 116 was issued on March 30, 2019 and it replaces existing standard on leases i.e. Ind AS 17, Leases with effect from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019.Ind AS 116 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under Ind AS 17. The standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees – leases of ‘low-value’ assets (e.g., personal computers) and short-term leases (i.e., leases with a lease term of 12 months or less).At the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments (i.e., the lease liability) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the right-of-use asset). Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset.Lessees will be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events (e.g., a change in the lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments). The lessee will generally recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right- of-use asset.

Lessor accounting under Ind AS 116 is substantially unchanged from today’s accounting under Ind AS 17. Lessors will continue to classify all leases using the same classification principle as in Ind AS 17 and distinguish between two types of leases: operating and finance leases.Ind AS 116, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019, requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive disclosures than under Ind AS 17.Transition to Ind AS 116The Company plans to adopt Ind AS 116 with modified retrospective method ie. no change to
prior period financial statements and will apply the standard to contracts or arrangements that were previously identified as leases applying Ind AS 17.The Company elects to use the exemptions proposed by the standard on lease contracts for which the lease terms ends within 12 months as of the date of initial application, and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value.The Company is evaluating the requirements of the new standard and assessing the impact on the financial statements.

Note 38 - Share Based Payments(a) Employee option planThe Company does not provide any equity-based compensation to its employees. However, the parent company, Colgate-Palmolive Company, U.S.A. (“the grantor”) maintains equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of stock- based awards to its executive directors and certain categories of officers and employees. The Parent’s Incentive Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock units. Exercise prices in the case of non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.A stock option gives an employee, the right to purchase shares of Colgate-Palmolive Company common stock at a fixed price for a specific period of time. Stock options generally have a term of six years from the date of grant and vest over a period of three years.A restricted stock unit provides an employee with a share of Colgate-Palmolive Company common stock upon vesting. Restricted stock units vest generally over a period of three years. Dividends will accrue with each restricted stock unit award granted subsequent to the grant date.The details pertaining to number of options, weighted average price and assumptions considered for fair value are disclosed below:ParticularsMarch 31, 2019March 31, 2018Weighted Average ExercisepriceNumber of options    Weighted Average Exercise priceNumber ofoptionsOptions outstanding at the beginning of the year4,1944,07,1953,9213,60,077Options granted/transferred during the year4,42697,3324,6641,14,248Exercised during the year2,893(72,928)3,204(40,306)Transferred to other group companies during the year4,498(20,776)4,148(23,580)Lapsed during the year4,705(27,770)4,303(3,244)Options outstanding at the end of the year4,3683,83,0534,1944,07,195Options vested and exercisable at the end of the year3,02,0712,23,416The weighted average share price at the dates of exercise of options exercised during the year ended March 31, 2019 was ` 4,996 (March 31, 2018 : ` 4,737)Share options outstanding at the end of the year have the following expiry dates and exercise pricesGrant yearExpiry YearExercise price (`)March 31, 2019March 31, 2018Number of optionsNumber of options2012 - 20132018 - 20192,795 - 3,47631,34778,6762014 - 20162018 - 20223,907 - 4,8901,92,3392,30,0032017 - 20182020 - 20244,440 - 4,7291,59,36798,516Total3,83,0534,07,195Weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at end of year3.37 Years3.49 Years
Note 38 - Share Based Payments...(Contd.) Fair Value of options grantedThe fair value at the grant date of options granted during the year ended March 31, 2019 was ` 617.53 per option (March 31, 2018 : ` 538.36 per option and ` 542.25 per option). The fair value at grant date is determined using the Black-Scholes Model which takes into account the exercise price, expected volatility, option’s life, the share price at grant date, expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option.The model inputs for the options granted during the year ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 are as below:ParticularsMarch 31, 2019March 31, 2018Expected volatility (%)17.70%15.99%Expected life of the options4.5 years4.5 yearsRisk free interest rate(%)2.80%1.76%Grant Year20182017Expiry Year20242023Expected dividend (%)2.46%2.19%The risk free interest rates are determined based on the zero-coupon sovereign bond yields with maturity equal to the expected term of the option. The expected volatility was determined based on the volatility of the equity share for the period of one year prior to issue of the option. Volatility calculation is based on historical stock prices using standard deviation of daily change in stock price. The historical period is taken into account to match the expected life of the option. Dividend yield has been calculated taking into account expected rate of dividend on equity share price as on grant date.(b) Restricted Stock Units (RSU’s)ParticularsMarch 31, 2019March 31, 2018     Weighted Average Grant date Fair valueNumber ofUnits     Weighted Average Grant date Fair valueNumber ofUnitsUnits outstanding at the beginning of the year4,05736,2844,36533,722Units granted / transferred during the year4,54010,8504,61213,131Exercised during the year3,611(8,107)3,768(7,769)Transferred to other group companies during the year4,801(847)3,403(2,280)Lapsed during the year4,645(3,551)5,086(520)Units outstanding at the end of the year4,61834,6294,05736,284Restricted Stock Units outstanding at the end of the year have the following expiry date and exercise pricesParticularsMarch 31, 2019March 31, 2018Weighted average remaining contractual life of RSUs outstanding at end of year1.11 Years1.34 YearsThe weighted average fair value at the date of exercise of RSU’s exercised during the year ended March 31, 2019 was` 4,801 (March 31, 2018 : ` 4,635)(c) Expenses Arising from share based payment transactionsTotal expenses arising from share-based payment transactions recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss as part of employee benefit expense were as follows:ParticularsMarch 31, 2019March 31, 2018Employee share based payment expense [Refer Note 29]8,06.779,41.64

Developing policies and processes to assess, monitor, manage and address these risks is the responsibility of the Company’s Management. The Risk Management Committee oversees this risk management framework in the Company and intervenes as necessary to ensure there exists  an appropriate level of safeguards against the key risks. Updates on compliance, exceptions  and mitigating action are placed before the Audit Committee periodically. Risk management policies and
systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes like major changes in ERP systems or go to market model, changes in organization structure, events denoting material change in the risk environment, etc.The Company’s Management works closely with its Treasury department and Internal Audit department to ensure there are appropriate policies and procedures governing the operations of the Company with a view to providing assurance that there is visibility into financial risks and that the business is being run in conformity with the stated risk objectives. Periodic reviews with concerned stakeholders provides an insight into risks to the business associated with currency movements, credit risks, commodity price fluctuations, etc. and necessary deliberations are undertaken to ensure there is an appropriate response to the developments.A	MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISKThe Company follows a conservative policy of ensuring sufficient liquidity at all times through a strategy of profitable growth, efficient working capital management as well as prudent capital expenditure and dividend policies. The Company has a overdraft facility with banks to support any temporary funding requirements. The Company is cognizant of reputational risks that are associated with the liquidity risk and the risk is factored into the overall business strategy.The Company’s treasury department regularly monitors the rolling forecasts to ensure it has sufficient cash on an on-going basis to meet operational needs. Any short term surplus cash generated by the operating entities, over and above the amount required for working capital management and other operational requirements, is retained as cash and cash equivalents (to the extent required) and any excess is invested in interest bearing term deposits and debt investments with appropriate maturities to optimise the cash returns on investments while ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities.As at March 31, 2019, the Company had undrawn letter of credit facilities in aggregate of ` Nil (March 31, 2018:` Nil).The following table shows the maturity analysis of the Company’s financial liabilities based on contractually agreed undiscounted cash flows as at the Balance Sheet date.` LakhsCarrying amountPayable     on demandLess than 3 months3-12monthsMore than 12 monthsTotalAs at March 31, 2019(i)	Borrowings77,71.09---77,71.0977,71.09(ii) Trade payables613,18.20-613,18.20--613,18.20(iii) Security Deposits1,18.13---1,18.131,18.13(iv) Capital Creditors2,59.23-2,59.23--2,59.23(v) Unpaid Dividends210,97.3120,58.32190,38.99--210,97.31(vi) Unpaid Balance of Share77.0577.05---77.05Capital Reduction(vii) Current maturities of finance5,43.13--5,43.13-5,43.13lease obligationsAs at March 31, 2018(i)	Trade payables614,46.80-614,46.80--614,46.80(ii) Security Deposits1,33.13---1,33.131,33.13(iii) Capital Creditors7,45.26-7,45.26--7,45.26(iv) Unpaid Dividends150,02.9114,03.63135,99.28--150,02.91(v) Unpaid Balance of Share74.2774.27---74.27Capital Reduction
B	MANAGEMENT OF MARKET RISKThe Company’s size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments:• currency risk;• commodity price risk;The above risks may affect the Company’s income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of the Company’s Management of market risk is to maintain this risk within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns. The Company’s exposure to, and management of, these risks is explained below.POTENTIAL IMPACT OF RISKMANAGEMENT POLICYSENSITIVITY TO RISK1.CURRENCY RISKThe Company is subject to the  risk of changes in foreign currency values that impact costs of imported raw material (directly and by local suppliers), import of finished goods, equipment for expansion  at the plants, expatriate costs, service  income,   reimbursement of expenses, service related charges from overseas related and third parties as well as revenue from exports. Receivable and Payable having foreign currencies denomination in the balance sheet will also be impacted.The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to USD, Euro, and Chinese Yuan. The Company's business model incorporates assumptions on currency risks and ensures any exposure is covered through the normal business operations. This intent has been achieved in all years presented.As an estimation of the approximate impact of the residual risk, with respect to financial instruments, the Company has calculated the impact of a 1% change in exchange rates.A 1% strengthening of the INR against key currencies to which the Company is exposed at year end would have led to approximately an additional ` 13.78 Lakhs pre-tax gain in the Statement of Profit and Loss (2017-18: ` 26.20 Lakhs pre-tax loss). A 1% weakening of the INR against these currencies would have led to an equal but opposite effect.As at March 31, 2019, the unhedged exposure to the Company on holding financial assets and liabilities other than in its functional currency amounted to ` 37,94.28 Lakhs and ` 51,72.01 Lakhs respectively (March 31, 2018: ` 57,74.52 Lakhs and ` 31,54.96 Lakhs)A 1% strengthening of the INR against key currencies would have led to approximately an additional pre-tax gain of ` 7,67 Lakhs in the Statement of Profit and Loss (2017- 18: ` 6,92 Lakhs pre-tax gain). A 1% weakening in currency prices would have led to an equal but opposite effect.2.COMMODITY PRICE RISKThe Company is exposed to the risk of changes in commodity prices in relation to its purchase of its raw materials especially corn, carton board, resins and palm oils.The Company develops periodic financial forecasts based on commodity  price  forecasts  by  its Procurement group and appropriate actions including selling price changes and cost saving  measures   to   reduce   the impact of commodity price changes is considered as part of the financial modelling.A 1% increase in commodity prices would have led  to  approximately  an additional ` 6,19 Lakhs loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss (2017-18: ` 6,52 Lakhs loss). A 1% weakening in commodity prices would have led to an equal but opposite effect.
C	MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISKCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or other counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations.Trade ReceivablesTrade receivables are subject to credit limits, controls and approval processes. A majority of customers pay prior to shipment, thereby reducing exposure to trade receivables significantly. Due to a large customer base, the Company is not exposed to material concentration of credit risk. Basis the historical experience supported by the level of default, the credit risk in case of trade receivable is low and so trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. (Refer Accounting Policy 1 B (h) on trade receivables.)The gross carrying amount of trade receivables is ` 209,78.64 Lakhs as at March 31, 2019 and ` 206,09.48 Lakhs as at March 31, 2018.(I) Reconciliation of loss allowance provision- Trade receivables` LakhsMarch 31, 2019March 31, 2018Loss allowance at the beginning of the year5,06.244,90.94Add / (Less) : Changes in loss allowances4,06.8815.30Loss allowance at the end of the year9,13.125,06.24(II) Ageing analysis of Trade receivables and provision of doubtful debts is as follows :Balance as on March 31, 2018` LakhsNot due0-180>180TotalAgeingGross carrying amount117,12.6879,25.909,70.90206,09.48Provision for doubtful debts--(5,06.24)(5,06.24)Carrying amount of trade receivables (net of Provision)117,12.6879,25.904,64.66201,03.24Balance as on March 31, 2019Not due0-180>180TotalAgeingGross carrying amount52,48.86155,53.1810,89.72218,91.76Provision for doubtful debts--(9,13.12)(9,13.12)Carrying amount of trade receivables (net of Provision)52,48.86155,53.181,76.60209,78.64Other financial assetsThe Company maintains exposure in cash and cash equivalents, term deposits with banks and investments in debt instruments. The Company has concentrated its main investment activities with a limited number of counter- parties which have secure credit ratings, to reduce this risk. Individual risk limits are set for each counter-party based on financial position, credit rating and past experience.
