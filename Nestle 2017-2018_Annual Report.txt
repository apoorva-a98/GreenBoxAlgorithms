I!
Dear Shareholders
2018 has been memorable and a year of many ‘firsts’. We started the year on a bright note, as by the end of 2017 we became the first listed pure play food  and beverage Company in India to reach a milestone crossing INR 10,000 crore in revenue. This historic milestone signifies the  strength  of  our  106-year  old business in India and will serve as a moment of inspiration as we continue to build for a healthier future. It is clear that a healthier future requires a healthier business and a healthier society, and my team and I are fully committed to this. We continued to build trust with consumers and communities by being responsible, transparent and maintained our focus on building long term relationships.Consumers have always been at the heart of our initiatives. We continued to offer exciting new product categories by introducing NESPLUS Breakfast Cereals, MAGGI  Nutri-licious  Baked   Noodles,   MAGGI   Dip  & Spread, NESCAFÉ Ready-to-Drink Cans, NESCAFÉ É Smart Coffee Machine and EVERYDAY Chai Life.In all our initiatives we were provided valuable support by Nestlé Group’s unmatched Research and Development network. Your Company has access to thousands of brands and technologies developed by the global network of Research and Development centres, including the one at Manesar, Haryana. Nestlé Group has also provided immense support in almost all areas of operation be it practices related to human resources, operational efficiencies, information technology or various initiatives with communities. I am grateful to Nestlé Group for their support over the past decades with brands, technology and expertise to establish the strong and durable foundations of your Company.As a responsible and responsive corporate citizen, we stepped up our initiatives towards plastic waste management. One of the initiatives we  launched last year was ‘2 Minute Safaai Ke Naam’. This included a pilot project in Dehradun and Mussoorie wherein consumers were given a packet of MAGGI Noodles for every 10 MAGGI noodle wrappers they return. We have also set up eco-warriors within the organization, wherein employees are doing their  own bit on spreading consumer education and awareness. At the same time we have taken steps to recycle the plastic waste in 12 states. The journey is continuing and we are making our best endeavor to have plastic neutrality in next few years. I am deeply inspired by my colleagues and external partners who resonate and dedicate their efforts to this purpose   of reducing the impact of plastic in the environment.At Nestlé India, we believe in enabling a healthier society through various on the ground initiatives. We recently celebrated the completion of three years of Project JAGRITI in association with MAMTA Health  Institute
for Mother and Child. It has reached out to over 4.5  million beneficiaries on creating awareness in the communities on issues related to  health,  nutrition,  and sanitation (HNS), in alignment with the national goals. Nestlé Healthy Kids has a program which creates awareness on nutrition and lifestyle, and has reached out to over 2.8 lakh adolescents.At Nestlé India, we believe in the power of long term relationships. In addition to  our  own  employees,  we work with hundreds of partners, thousands of suppliers and millions of farmers around the world. Our collective aim is to help develop thriving and resilient communities as part of a secure, long-term supply chain.The consumer landscape is evolving rapidly across India. It is important to engage the many ‘India’s’ within India’, where every 100 kilometers, people experience a different India and diverse consumer behaviour. Brands need to embrace the varied needs, habits and perception of our rich consumer base, by engaging with them through localisation and personalisation of their product offering. We therefore adopted the regional cluster approach for increased penetration leading to volume-led growth.The country is evolving into new modes for consumption trying out new things, new experimentations, new lifestyles and new cuisines. We will accelerate innovation and renovation to participate in the consumer journey by focussing on our core values and purpose of ‘enhancing quality of life and contributing to a healthier future’. The future of our brands at Nestlé India continue to be exciting and our collective energies are focused to harness the many opportunities to build a healthier future for our consumers and thus make our small contribution to the well-being of the nation. In this context, the support from Nestlé Group is essential and we look forward to continued access to latest state of the art technologies developed by the group along with worldwide brands and processes developed in many relevant areas.Suresh NarayananChairman & Managing Director Nestlé India Limited

The economy regained after a temporary slowdown due to demonetisation and the implementation of GST. Economic activity continued to recover with strong domestic demand and increase in consumption remained a major contributor to this growth. India emerged as the fastestgrowing major world economy in 2018 despite increased global vulnerabilities, such as rising oil prices, escalated trade wars between global partners, and the US monetary shutdown.During the year 2018, India made some important strides. It climbed another 23 points in the World Bank’s ease of doing business index to the 77th position, for the first time.
During the year 2018, the Food Processing sector grew at an average pace of 8% per annum. Government’s flagship programmes played a significant role towards boosting investment in this sector.Opportunities and RisksAided by consumer demand, private consumption remains robust in India. Healthy demand growth outlook will continue to boost the economy. The rural markets performed well because of numerous government schemes and also because of the growing income levels of the rural population. Consumption in the  rural market was buttressed by a large base of technologically savvy Indian consumer.The young India, is aspirational, this is reflected in the lifestyle choices adopted by them, both  in their personal and professional life. The availability of high disposable income and exposure to a rapidly changing environment is encouraging the millennials to consider health and wellness as an important part of overallwell-being that complements their changing and upwardly mobile lifestyle.

Packaging and Plastic Waste Management ‘2 Minute Safaai Ke Naam’Your Company believes that there is a need to engage with consumers and bring about a behavioural change about the need fordisposing plastic waste responsibly. Therefore, your Company designed a campaign for this purpose and called it, ‘2 Minute Safaai Ke Naam’ (2 minutes for cleanliness) in Dehradun and Mussoorie.

Also, there was an urgent need to showcase that multi layered plastic waste, when properly collected, segregated and disposed can be processed and managed till the end of its life. A consortium
which initially comprised of 5 companies was formed. The consortium engaged with various NGOs, waste management service providers and conducted successful pilot projects to manage multilayered plastics effectively. The projects focus on the following:• Awareness and training programmes for rag pickers• Improve livelihood of waste pickers• Collection, segregation and recycling of post- consumer wastePost successful pilots, the consortium started working in the states of Punjab and Maharashtra.

Annexure B referred to in our Independent Auditor’s Report ofeven date on the financial statements of Nestlé India LimitedReport on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub- section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of Nestlé India Limited (“the Company") as of 31 December 2018 in conjunction with our audit of the Ind AS financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial ControlsThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information as required under the Companies Act, 2013.Auditors’ ResponsibilityOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system with reference to financial statements.Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Financial StatementsA company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control with reference to financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly refect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Financial StatementsBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.OpinionIn our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were operating effectively as at 31 December 2018, based on the internal control with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.For B S R & Co.

NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1 - CORPORATE INFORMATIONNestlé India Limited (“the Company") is a company domiciled in India, with its registered office situated at 100/101, World Trade Centre, Barakhamba Lane, New Delhi - 110 001. The Company has been incorporated under the provisions of Indian Companies Act and its equity shares are listed on the BSE Limited in India. The Company is primarily involved in Food business which incorporates product groups viz. Milk Products and Nutrition, Prepared dishes and Cooking aids, Powdered and Liquid Beverages and Confectionery.2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBASIS OF PREPARATION AND MEASUREMENTStatement of complianceThe financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with and to comply in all material aspects with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 and the relevant provisions of the Act, as applicable.Basis of measurementThe financial statements have been prepared on accrual and going concern basis under the historical cost convention except for certain class of financial assets/ liabilities, share based payments and net liability for defined benefit plans that are measured at fair value. The accounting policies have been consistently applied by the Company unless stated otherwise.Previous year’s figures have been regrouped / reclassified wherever necessary to conform with the current year’s classification/ disclosures.Financial YearThe Company has opted the period of 1st day of January to 31st day of December, each year as its financial year for the purpose of preparation of financial statements under the provisions of Section 2(41) of the Companies Act, 2013, which the Company Law Board has allowed.Functional and Presentation CurrencyThe financial statements have been prepared and presented in Indian Rupees (`), which is also the Company’s functional currency.Rounding offAll amounts in the financial statement and accompanying notes are presented in ` million and have been rounded-off to one decimal place unless stated otherwise.Current and Non-current  ClassificationThe Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current / non-current classification of assets and liabilities. This is based on the nature of products and the time between acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents.Measurement of Profit from OperationsFor better understanding of the financial performance, the Company has chosen to present “Profit from Operations" as an additional information in the Statement of Profit and Loss. “Profit from Operations" is arrived from ‘Profit before Tax’ after reducing Other Income and adding back Finance Costs (including interest cost on employee benefit plans), Net provision for contingencies (others) and corporate social responsibility expense.Use of Estimates and JudgementThe preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement and make estimates and assumptions that affects the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from
these estimates. These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the results are known/materialise.The areas involving significant estimates and judgement include determination of useful life of property, plant and equipment (Refer note 5), measurement of defined benefit obligations (Refer note 34), recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies (Refer note 37) and recognition of deferred tax assets/liabilities (Refer note 39).Approval of financial statementsThe financial statements of the Company were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 14 February 2019.REVENUE RECOGNITIONRevenue from sale of goods is recognised on transfer of significant risks & rewards of ownership and effective control to the buyer. Revenue is measured at the price charged to the customer and are recorded net of returns (if any), trade discounts, rebates, other pricing allowances to trade/consumer, when it is probable that the associated economic benefits will fow to the company.Sales are presented gross of excise duty and net of Goods and Services Tax (GST), Value Added Tax (VAT)/ Sales Tax, wherever applicable.In accordance with Ind AS 18 on “Revenue" and Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, Sales for the period 1 January to 30 June 2017 in the previous year were reported gross of Excise Duty and net of Value Added Tax (VAT)/ Sales Tax. Excise Duty was reported as a separate expense line item. Consequent to the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) with effect from 1 July 2017, VAT/Sales Tax, Excise Duty etc. have been subsumed into GST and accordingly the same is not recognised as part of sales as per the requirements of Ind AS 18.Interest income is recognised using effective interest rate (EIR) method.Dividend income on investments is recognised when the right to receive the payment is established.GOVERNMENT GRANTSGovernment grant in relation to fixed asset is treated as deferred income and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.Government grant in relation to investment outlay is recognised as income in the statement of profit & loss on fulfillment of the underlying attached conditions.INVENTORIESInventories are stated at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. However, raw materials, packing materials and other supplies held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished goods in which they will be included are expected to be sold at or above cost. The bases of determining cost for various categories of inventories are as follows:Raw and packing material	:	First-in-first out Stock-in-trade (Goods purchased for resale)	:	Weighted average Stores and spare parts	:	Weighted averageWork-in-progress and finished goods	:	Material cost plus appropriate share of production overheads and excise duty, wherever applicableEMPLOYEE BENEFITSEmployee benefit plansThe Company makes contributions to Provident Fund, Employee State Insurance, National Pension System etc. for eligible employees and these contributions are charged to statement of profit and loss on accrual basis.
NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLiability for defined benefit plans i.e. gratuity and unfunded pension is determined based on the actuarial valuation carried out by an independent actuary as at the year-end. As these liabilities are relatively long term in nature, the actuarial assumptions take in account the requirements of the relevant Ind AS coupled with a long term view of the underlying variables / trends, wherever required.Service cost and net interest cost on the defined benefit liabilities/assets are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as employee benefit expense and finance costs respectively. Gains and losses on remeasurement of defined benefits liabilities/plan assets arising from changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments are recognised in the other comprehensive income and are included in retained earnings in the balance sheet.Long term employee benefits such as compensated absences and long service awards are charged to statement of profit and loss on the basis of an actuarial valuation carried out by an independent actuary as at the year-end. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of profit and loss during the year in which they occur.Other employee benefitsShort term employee benefits including performance incentives, are charged to statement of profit and loss on an undiscounted, accrual basis during the period of employment.SHARE BASED PAYMENTNestlé Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan/ Performance Share Unit (PSU) Plan of Nestlé S.A., whereby select employees of the Company are granted non-tradable units with the right to obtain Nestlé S.A. shares or cash equivalent, is a Cash-Settled Share based payment as per the requirement of Ind AS 102 - Shared based Payment. Liability under the plan is initially measured at the fair value and charged to statement of profit and loss over the vesting period. The Company remeasures the outstanding units at each balance sheet date at their fair values taking into account the Nestlé S.A. share price and exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. The resultant gain/ (loss) on remeasurement is recognised in the statement of profit and loss over the vesting period.PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENTItems of property, plant & equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost is inclusive of freight, duties, taxes or levies (net of recoverable taxes) and any directly attributable cost of bringing the assets to their working condition for intended use.Property, plant and equipment which are not ready for intended use as on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as “Capital work-in-progress".Profit or loss on disposal/ scrapping/ write off/ retirement from active use of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.DEPRECIATION / AMORTISATIONThe Company has assessed the useful lives of property, plant and equipment as per Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. Accordingly, depreciation has been computed on useful lives based on technical evaluation of relevant class of assets including components thereof. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually. Depreciation is provided as per the straight line method computed basis useful lives of fixed assets as follows:Buildings	:	25 - 40 yearsPlant & Machinery	:	5 - 25 yearsOffice Equipments	:	5 yearsFurniture and fixtures	:	5 yearsVehicles	:	5 yearsInformation Technology (IT) equipment	:	3 - 5 yearsFreehold land is not depreciated. Leasehold land and related improvements are amortized over the period of the lease.
IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENTAt each balance sheet date, items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the levels for which there are separately identifiable cash fows (cash generating unit). If any impairment indicator exists, estimate of the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment /cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is made. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset/ cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash fows are discounted to their present value based on an appropriate discount rate.Reversal of impairment losses recognised in earlier years is recorded when there is an indication that the impairment losses recognised for the asset/cash generating unit no longer exist or have decreased. However, the increase in carrying amount of an asset due to reversal of an impairment loss is recognised to the extent it does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for that asset/cash generating unit in earlier years.LEASESThe determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset/s and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset/s, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless such payments are structured to increase in line with expected general infation to compensate for the lessor’s expected infationary cost increases, in which case the same is recognised as an expense in line with the contractual term.FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONSTransactions in foreign currency are initially recorded in the functional currency i.e. Indian Rupees (`) using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.Monetary items (i.e. receivables, payables, loans etc.) denominated in foreign currency are reported using the closing exchange rate as on each balance sheet date.The exchange difference arising on the settlement or reporting of monetary items at rates different from rates at which these were initially recorded / reported in previous financial statements, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.Also refer to accounting policy on ‘Derivatives and Hedge accounting’.PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIESProvisions for Contingencies/ Contingent liabilities are recognised/disclosed after evaluation of facts and legal aspects of the matter involved, in line with Ind AS 37 on Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal/constructive) and on management judgement as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that a cash outfow will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. As the timing of outfow of resources is uncertain, being dependent upon the outcome of the future proceedings, these provisions are not discounted to their present value.A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not require an outfow of resources. When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which likelihood of outfow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be accrued/ realised.
NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSBORROWING COSTSBorrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of items of property, plant and equipment which take substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs are charged to the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSa) Recognition and Initial measurementThe Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on initial recognition. Transaction costs in relation to financial assets and financial liabilities, other than those carried at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), are added to the fair value on initial recognition. Transaction costs in relation to financial assets and financial liabilities which are carried at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), are charged to the statement of profit and loss.b) Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assetsi) Debt InstrumentsFor the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets in the nature of debt instruments are classified as follows:Amortised cost - Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash fows that are solely payments of principal and interest are subsequently measured at amortised cost less impairments, if any. Interest income calculated using effective interest rate (EIR) method and impairment loss, if any are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both holding the asset in order to collect contractual cash fows that are solely payments of principal and interest and by selling the financial assets, are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Changes in fair value are recognized in the other comprehensive income (OCI) and on derecognition, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the statement of profit and loss. Interest income calculated using EIR method and impairment loss, if any are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) - A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are subsequently measured at fair valued through profit or loss. Changes in fair value and income on these assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.ii) Equity InstrumentsThe Company has made investment in equity instruments that are initially measured at fair value. These investment are strategic in nature and held on a long-term basis. Accordingly, the company has elected irrevocable option to measure such investments at FVOCI. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Pursuant to such irrevocable option, changes in fair value are recognised in the OCI and is subsequently not reclassified to the statement of profit and loss.c) Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilitiesFor the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities are classified as follows:Amortised cost - Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost by default. Interest expense calculated using EIR method is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) - Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL if it is held for trading, or is designated as such on initial recognition. Changes in fair value and interest expense on these liabilities are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
d) Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilitiesThe Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash fows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash fows including risks and rewards of ownership.A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or expires.e) Impairment of financial assetsFinancial assets that are carried at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are assessed for possible impairments basis expected credit losses taking into account the past history of recovery, risk of default of the counterparty, existing market conditions etc. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.For Trade receivables, the Company provides for expected credit losses based on a simplified approach as per Ind AS 109- Financial Instruments. Under this approach, expected credit losses are computed basis the probability of defaults over the lifetime of the asset.f) Derivatives and hedge accountingDerivative instruments used by the company include forward contracts. The Company formally establishes a hedge relationship between such forward contracts (‘hedging instrument’) and recognized financial asset/liabilities (‘hedged item’) through a formal documentation at the inception of the hedge. Forward contracts are designated as hedging instruments against changes in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (fair value hedges) and against highly probable forecast transactions (cash fow hedges). The effectiveness of hedge instruments is assessed at the inception and on an ongoing basis.Derivatives instruments such as forward contracts are initially measured at fair value. When a forward contract is designated as a cash fow hedge, the effective portion of change in the fair value of the contract is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated in other equity under “effective portion of cash fow hedges". Amount recognised in other equity is subsequently reclassified to the statement of profit and loss upon occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the contract is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.Changes in fair value of forward contracts designated as fair value hedge are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.g) Fair value measurementFair value of financial assets and liabilities is normally determined by references to the transaction price or market price. If the fair value is not reliably determinable, the company determines the fair value using valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.INCOME TAXIncome tax expense comprises of current tax and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except when it relates to items recognised in the other comprehensive income or items recognised directly in the equity. In such cases, the income tax expense is also recognised in the other comprehensive income or directly in the equity as applicable.Provision for current tax for the period comprises ofa) estimated tax expense which has accrued on the profit for the period 1 April 2018 to 31 December 2018 and,b) the residual tax expense for the period 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 arising out of the finalisation of fiscal accounts (Assessment Year 2018-2019), under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, 1961.Deferred taxes are recognised basis the balance sheet approach on temporary differences, being the difference between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet and its corresponding tax base, that originate in one period and are
NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTScapable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which such assets can be utilized.EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares, if any.CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTSCash and cash equivalents for the purpose of Statement of Cash Flows include bank balances, cheques and drafts on hand including remittances in transit, demand deposits with banks where the original maturity is three months or less and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of Statement of Cash fows.EVENTS OCCURING AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATEAll material events occurring after the balance sheet date upto the date of approval of financial statements by the board of directors on 14 February 2019, have been considered, disclosed and adjusted, wherever applicable, as per the requirements of Ind AS 10 - Events after the Reporting Period.3 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIND AS 115: Revenue from Contracts with CustomersIn March 2018, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) (Amendments) Rules, 2018, notifying Ind AS 115, ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. The Standard is applicable to the Company with effect from 1 January 2019.Revenue from Contracts with Customers Ind AS 115 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Ind AS 115 will supersede the current revenue recognition standard Ind AS 18 Revenue, Ind AS 11 Construction Contracts when it becomes effective. The core principle of Ind AS 115 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers for an amount that refects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Specifically, the standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition:• Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer• Step 2: Identify the performance obligation in contract• Step 3: Determine the transaction price• Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract• Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligationUnder Ind AS 115, an entity recognises revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when ‘control’ of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer. The Company has evaluated Ind AS 115 and does not anticipate any significant impact.
4 - Impact of implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the financial statementsIn accordance with Ind AS 18 on “Revenue" and Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, Sales for the period 1 January to 30 June 2017 in the previous year were reported gross of Excise Duty and net of Value Added Tax (VAT)/ Sales Tax. Excise duty was reported as a separate expense line item. Consequent to the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) with effect from 1 July 2017, VAT/Sales Tax, Excise duty etc. have been subsumed into GST and accordingly the same is not recognised as part of sales as per the requirements of Ind AS 18. This has resulted in lower reported sales in the current year in comparison to the sales reported in the previous year under the pre-GST structure of indirect taxes. With the change in structure of indirect taxes, expenses are also being reported net of taxes. Accordingly, financial results for the year ended 31 December 2018 and in particular Sales, absolute expenses and ratios in percentage of Sales are not comparable with the previous year.5 - Property, Plant and Equipment(` in million)GROSS BLOCKDEPRECIATION/ AMORTISATIONNET BLOCK   Cost as at 31 December2017Additions Deletions / adjustments   Cost as at 31 December2018 As at 31 December2017For the yearImpairmentloss (1)On deletions/ adjustments As at 31 December2018 As at 31 December2018Freehold land174.00.1-174.1-----174.1Leasehold land1,231.0--1,231.025.813.1--38.91,192.1Buildings9,032.096.24.29,124.0780.4375.9-1.41,154.97,969.1Plant and machinery21,804.11,013.622.122,795.65,750.72,758.6110.85.18,615.014,180.6Furniture and fixtures707.911.510.5708.9567.557.1-9.1615.593.4Office equipment132.522.66.6148.556.227.5-6.677.171.4IT equipment477.6189.619.4647.8231.6119.1-19.1331.6316.2Vehicles25.2-0.924.310.35.4-0.715.09.3Total33,584.31,333.663.734,854.27,422.53,356.7110.842.010,848.024,006.2GROSS BLOCKDEPRECIATION/ AMORTISATIONNET BLOCK   Cost as at 31 December2016Additions Deletions / adjustments   Cost as at 31 December2017 As at 31 December2016For the yearImpairmentloss (1)On deletions/ adjustments As at 31 December2017 As at 31 December2017Freehold land174.0--174.0-----174.0Leasehold land1,231.0--1,231.012.713.1--25.81,205.2Buildings8,650.0382.60.69,032.0408.5371.11.00.2780.48,251.6Plant and machinery19,724.02,168.488.321,804.12,674.42,719.1370.813.65,750.716,053.4Furniture and fixtures688.324.95.3707.9410.6161.8-4.9567.5140.4Office equipment113.021.21.7132.529.526.9-0.256.276.3IT equipment344.2134.91.5477.6108.5124.3-1.2231.6246.0Vehicles26.7-1.525.25.66.2-1.510.314.9Total30,951.22,732.098.933,584.33,649.83,422.5371.821.67,422.526,161.8(1)	Refer Note 36

Employee Benefit Plans(i) The Company makes contributions to the Provident Fund, Employee State Insurance, National Pension System etc. for eligible employees. Under these plans, the Company is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs. The Company has recognised ` 421.4 million (Previous year ` 368.0 million) as expense in the statement of profit and loss during the year towards contribution to these funds.Out of the total contribution made for Provident Fund, ` 169.5 million (Previous year ` 144.6 million) is made to the Nestlé India Limited Employees Provident Fund Trust. The members of the Provident Fund Trust are entitled to the rate of interest declared by the Central Government under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. The shortfall, if any, is made good by the Company in the year in which it arises. The Trustees of Nestlé India Limited Employees Provident Fund Trust are responsible for the overall governance of the plan and to act in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed and the relevant provisions prescribed under the law. Pattern of investment followed by the Trust is in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Government of India.The total plan liabilities under the Nestlé India Limited Employees Provident Fund Trust as at 31 December 2018 as per the unaudited financial statements are ` 3531.4 million (Previous year ` 3,316.3 million) as against total plan assets of` 3,532.2 million (Previous year ` 3,326.4 million). The funds of the Trust have been invested under various securities in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Government of India.(ii) Pension and Gratuity Plans: The Company provides pension and gratuity to eligible employees under defined benefit plans. The gratuity plan provides for a lump sum payment to employees upon vesting at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment. Gratuity vesting occurs upon completion of five years of service.The Company makes contributions to the Nestlé India Limited Employees’ Gratuity Trust Fund. The Trustees of Nestlé India Limited Employees Gratuity Trust Fund are responsible for the overall governance of the plan and to act in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed and the relevant provisions prescribed under the law. Pattern of investment followed by the Gratuity Trust fund is in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Government of India.

There are overheads of `13.7 million, and the total expenditure including overheads is `273.7 million.With its CSR Policy focus areas firmly embedded in its Purpose, in 2018, the Company focused its activities on creating nutrition, health and breastfeeding awareness, providing access to clean drinking water and sanitation, supporting development of agricultural communities while helping them reduce water use and enhancing the livelihood of street food vendors. These initiatives are built upon the strong base of performance in environmental sustainability, applicable laws, international standards and our Corporate Business Principles. CSR programmes are detailed here under:- Nestlé Healthy Kids ProgrammeIndia has 253 million adolescents (10 to 19 years) that constitute about one-fifth of India’s population. This is more than any other country in the world that makes adolescent health particularly important to India to meet the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs)-a set of universal goals to end poverty, hunger and achieve equality, which our country has committed. The Nestlé Healthy Kids Programme has been developed with a focus to raise nutrition, health and wellness awareness among adolescents. The programme contributes towards overall development of adolescents as well as encourages healthier lifestyle in the communities, by arming them with knowledge that impacts them in a meaningful way. The unbranded programme is being conducted since 2009 and is helping raise awareness regarding good nutritional and cooking practices, good hygiene and promoting physical fitness. The programme is implemented through two modes, one is in partnership with six regional universities and the second is with NGO Magic Bus India Foundation.a) Six leading regional Universities through the Department of Home Science and Food Science conduct this programme wherein information on the nutrition status of the region and local food habits is collected through their extension activities and the programme content is developed jointly with Nestlé India team. Each student receives over twelve hours of nutrition training and pre and post programme behavioural and knowledge tests are conducted to measure the effectiveness of learning and implementation.b) To scale up, the Company joined hands with the NGO Magic Bus India Foundation, one of India’s largest behaviour change organisations, to extend its commitment to promote healthier lifestyles through the ‘sports for development’ model. Adolescents are engaged in interactive sessions in which they receive nutrition and health knowledge and are encouraged to play regularly. The programme is implemented through game sessions, delivered in a manner where adolescents remember everything they are taught because they are actively engaged and are more willing to absorb the information.Till year 2018, over 280,000 adolescents across 22 states have been encouraged to live healthier lives through Nestlé Healthy Kids Programme.- Project JagritiIndia has been grappling with malnutrition for decades now. According to the World Bank, it is one of the countries in the world that has children suffering from malnutrition with dire consequences for mobility, mortality, and cognitive impairment. When children start their lives malnourished, the negative effects are largely irreversible as pregnancy and infancy are the most important periods for brain development. It is therefore important to intervene in the community to change the dynamics that create the barriers to development for children and mothers.With the shared vision of healthier communities, the Company rolled out Project Jagriti in partnership with the Mamta Health Institute for Mother and Child, aiming to improve health of women, young couples, children and adolescents. The programme has strong focus on maternal nutrition and creates peer mentor support groups for counselling on good nutrition for pregnant and lactating women, encouraging the early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding, improving breastfeeding practices and encouraging the uptake of public health services. The programme creates an enabling environment for the best health outcomes, involving the health care system and stakeholders from the community. The adolescent friendly and gender-sensitive inclusive approach is useful in such vulnerable populations that are deficient in knowledge and unaware of their health needs and rights.The programme started with a pilot in Delhi in year 2014, reaching out to over 100,000 people living in marginalized conditions to educate and encourage community support for good nutrition and breastfeeding practices. In the year 2016, the programme was scaled up and ran across 15 districts of Rajasthan, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Chandigarh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi. In three years (2016-18), it has positively impacted over 4.6 million lives- 1.5 million direct reach that is accounted through Management Information Systems (MIS) and 3.1 million people benefitted indirectly.- Clean Drinking Water Projects and Water Awareness ProgrammeClean water supplies are vital to any thriving community, reducing exposure to water-borne diseases and easing the burden of ill health. Lack of safe drinking water poses health risks and water-borne diseases such as diarrhea and gastroenteritis to millions of people across the country who still live with the challenge of non-availability of clean drinking water.To help improve access to clean drinking water, the Company began constructing drinking water facilities in schools around all its factories in 1999. The Company constructs clean drinking water facilities in schools directly and through NGO partner Enable Health Society. The Company also conducts periodic water quality checks to ensure clean drinking water, while involving the school and surrounding community through joint ownership of the water tanks, which helps to establish better upkeep and maintenance of the tanks.
The Company partnered with the Department of Medical and Health, Government of Rajasthan to offer access to clean drinking water at 12 Public Health Centres where the Company provides clean drinking water through its NGO partner, Enable Health Society as a part of the Adarsh Public Health Center Yojna established by the Government.Till year 2018, the Company has constructed over 260 water tanks across 7 states benefitting more than 136,800 students. The Company conducts Water Awareness Programmes aimed at ensuring hygienic and sustainable water use, reaching out to over 112,700 students.- Sanitation FacilitiesAvailability of basic sanitation is a serious challenge, with open defecation being a health risk for everyone, more so for the female population. It affects the attendance of girl students in school and often leaves them vulnerable to sanitation-related diseases. It is estimated that a quarter of girls drop out of school for reasons related to the lack of basic sanitation. In some places, nearly two-thirds skip school during menstruation and one-third eventually drop out altogether.The Company has constructed modern, easily maintainable modular toilets to reduce the dropout rate caused by lack of proper sanitation facilities. These facilities are provided for girl students in schools across all its factory and branch locations. This has had a direct positive impact on the attendance of girls in schools.Through this initiative, the Company endeavours to eliminate what is considered the major cause of dropouts among girl students in village schools. During 2018, the Company has set up sanitation facilities in government schools and so far has set up over 550 facilities benefitting more than 182,000 girl students across 14 states.- Water Conservation in AgricultureIndia is facing a severe water crisis with the availability of potable water and ground water drastically decreasing over the years. The agricultural sector remains the largest user of the India’s fresh water, responsible for about 70% of water consumption.The Company launched a water stewardship initiative with AgSRI at the Kabini river Basin in Karnataka. Over the years, the water demand in the catchment has been increasing, leading to inadequate supply. The Company commissioned a study to understand the current water management and implement applicable water interventions. The study found that river water discharges would continue to deplete while the competing requirements for drinking water and irrigation increase. As agriculture is the largest user of water from the catchment, the Company is working with AgSRI to implement pilot projects promoting the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and the Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative (SSI) that trains farmers on ecologically sustainable practices to reduce the agricultural water withdrawal from the catchment area, while improving agricultural productivity.This makes it possible to have more yield and good income by using less seeds, less water and fewer fertilizers besides reducing the number of labourers and expenditure. The SRI and SSI method can be used for cultivating sugarcane, paddy and coffee. Till the year 2018, the project has covered 101 hectares under SRI with 144 farmers and under SSI 55 hectares were covered with 110 farmers.- Project Serve Safe FoodWhile street food vending is an important source of informal employment for a large number of population, a variety of constraints including lack of knowledge and skills in business, limited training opportunities, and restricted mobility prevents street vendors from improving their capacities. More importantly, links between food and health are increasingly recognized and training street food vendors helps raise the standards for food safety and hygiene.Recognizing the potential of street food vending as an important source of livelihood, the Company joined hands with Nidan and national and local food authorities, including the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) in Delhi, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Ministry of Medical and Health Services in Rajasthan, Directorate of Food and Drugs Administration in Goa and the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Kerala to launch Project ‘Serve Safe Food’ for training street food vendors.The programme aims to help them improve their income by upgrading their skills and practices, sustain their livelihoods and enter into strategic employment opportunities in new market conditions. The training of street food vendors is conducted by NASVI and comprise subjects such as health, hygiene, food handling, waste disposal and entrepreneurship. The participants are also certified at the end of the training. With these trainings, the street food vendors are better equipped with knowledge and take adequate precautions to prevent the spread of food borne diseases, for example usage of disposable gloves, cart and personal hygiene.
Till 2018, programme was implemented across 12 states including Goa, Rajasthan, U.P., Kerala, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Odisha, J&K and Delhi, reaching out to 14,165 street food vendors who were also awarded a certificate and presented a hygiene kit at the end of the training.- Employee Volunteering ProgrammeEmployee Volunteering Programme (EVP) is an initiative launched in 2014 where a Nestlé employee volunteers to spend a day interacting with children from government schools and underprivileged communities to help create awareness regarding healthy eating and active lifestyle.Till 2018, 1850 employees across 27 locations (Head Office, branches and factories) have participated in the activities.- Relief EffortsThe Company provided support when state of Kerala was hit by foods by supporting relief operations. As part of the efforts, the Company supplied packaged food and beverages, including milk, coffee and instant noodles to the people affected.6. In case the Company has failed to spend the two per cent of the average net profit of the last three financial years or any part thereof, the Company shall provide the reasons for not spending the amount in its Board report.Not Applicable.7.
