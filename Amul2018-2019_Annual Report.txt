Ladies & Gentlemen,

I  am  happy  to welcome  you all at the 73rd Annual General Meeting of our Union. With your continued support and cooperation, our union has been able to achieve 73 years of long and glorious journey in dairy industry and continue its stride and has provided an ideal example in development, quality and production for which I congratulate all of you. We will always remain indebted to our founders and visionaries, Shri Sardar Vallabhai Patel, Shri Tribhuvandas Patel and Dr. V. Kurien and pay our tribute to them. We cherish their selfless contribution for milk producers and Amul.
In India, more than half of the rural population have no land of their own. More than 40% of small and marginal farmers depend for their livelihood on agriculture and other related activities.
In India, animal husbandry has remained the backbone of livelihood for small and marginal farmers despite adversities like famine, flood and economic recession.
For international dairy industry year 2018-19 has been a difficult year. Import and export hurdles in Russia, lower demand for dairy products in Chinese marke,t milk and milk

product regulations in Germany and other European countries have created upheavals ininternational markets.
In many countries, in comparison to year 2017, milk procurement rates were lower by 30to60%.This has resulted in reduction upto 30 % in the price of our products like milk powder and butter. Our country was also affected by international markets.
The price of milk powder in India reached 130/- to 150/- per kg.directly impacting milk procurement pricesby 4/- to 5/-per liter.
I am happy to convey that we could survive despite recessionary conditions in national and international markets.
During the year 2018-19, we procured 20% more milk as compared to previous year and onan average paid 700/- per kg.fat.
As a result of our persistent belief in cooperative structure and unity, we have been able to achieve economic progress through animal husbandry. Our continuous and significant progress has set an example for the dairy industry, for which we all can be proud of.

As you know, Amul's strength lies in efficient milk procurement under cooperative model and production of dairy products conforming to world standards, the credit of which goes to our primary societies and producer members. During the year under review, we installed bulk milk coolers at many Societies with the funding from Central Government governed NCDC. In our 1,198 functional societies, we have installed 1,221 BMCs for milk procurement. This ensures quality milk procurement which can be considered major achievement. This
Production
In the year under review, production of Amul products like milk powder, butter, ghee, flavored milk, chocolate, paneer, cheese and ice cream has shown significant increase. Along with increased production, our Union has adopted world class and latest technologies to meetthe expectation of quality

All the milk procured from societies is collected in chilled condition and brought to Amul which has significantly improved the quality of milk collected. This has resulted in increased demand for Amul products from outside countries which has enabled us to enhance exports, which in turn has helped us in optimum utilization of our plant capacity.

In cooperative model, milk producers areat the foundation stage. In our 3-tier cooperative framework, satisfaction of milk producers and their unflinching faith in the system is of utmost importance. Therefore, the Union organizes various developmental programmes in coordination with the members and the milk societies. As a part of such developmental programmes, with a view to set future targets for the societies and to outline a plan for implementaiton, a three day Vision Mission Seminar (VMS) was organized, in which 3,553 members of 32 Milk Societies participated. With a view to improve animal husbandry activities of members, in a systematic manne,r

For increase in milk yield, healthy animals, animal breeding, animal nutrition and protection of animal health are fundamental. Keeping this objective in mind, ARDA has been undertaking various activities like treatment of animals, Artificial Insemination, treatment against worms, vaccination, Infertility Camps etc. since long. During the year under review, 8.88 lakh animals were treated at farmers' doorsteps, through 14 Veterinary Centers. At Ode Semen Station,
44.19 lakh semen doses were produced of high quality Murah Buffalo, HF, Shankar and Gir bulls and total of 21.23 lakh doses of high pedigree cow/buffalo semen were distributed in our milk shed area. Latest equipment were purchased and technical and infrastructure development was undertaken at the Insemination center under the aggies of financial aid received from N.D.D.B. through World Bank under National Dairy Plan - I.
Under the program to enhance productivity of Shankar breed of cows, 4,671 imported semen doses were distributed among our Societies, out of which 788 pregnant cases were observed from 1,612 insemination of animals.
During the year under review, through 1,100 Al Centers, a total of 10.05 lakhcows andbuffalos were given artificial insemination. With the



objective to extend the benefits received from artificial insemination, members of 903 societies are being provided small Nitrogen Cylinders and Al facilities are beingprovided at farmers' doorstep.
Infertility of milch animals adversely affects the profitability of animal husbandry business. Since last 11 years, ARDA has initiated Fertility Improvement Program {FIP) to reduce the number of infertile animals and to retain interest of members in animal husbandry. During  the  year under review, under the 10th phase of "Fertility Improvement Program'; 62,125 infertile animals were registered and treated from 466 societies, out of which 45,855 became pregnant. In  the  11'h    phase, 95,787 infertile animals were registered and treated covering 537 societies. Moreover, 28,144 animals were treated in 660 infertility camps, results of which are encouraging.
To combat Internal Parasite disease, under the Mass De-worming Program, 8.98lakh packets of m ed ica t ed feed was distributed at subsidized rates. For controlling Infectious diseases in milch animals, 23.73 lakh animals for Foot & Mouth (FMD), 12.57 lakh animals for Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (HS), 84,125 cross bred animals for Theileriosis fever and 1 ,10, 004 calves for brucellosis were vaccinated.

Information Technology


To monitor and coordinate activities of Union and Milk Societies, to provide the benefit of latest software to all societies and producer members, it is necessary to have common software. We have started installing Amul - Automatic Milk Collection System (Amul? AMCS). By installing common software in all societies, we can avail advantages of central data base, web application, centralized management, data security improvement and SMSnotifications.
With the installation of this system, each and every member can be provided with receipt of milk quantity, fat and payment details. Members can access complete details of their account through mobile application. Society

Chairman and Secretary will also be in a position to access information of their society through smart phones. They will also be in a position to view the circulars. Every individual society will have their own website where details of society, information, photos and other relevant datacanbe accessed online.
SAP, Veterinary Call Centre, Online Society Supervision, Cattle Feed Call Centre, Employee Self Service Portal and CCTV Monitoring Systems were successfully implemented for which we all can feel proud. This indicates successful adoption and synchronization of Information Technology in our business.

Our glorious history guides us to our bright future ahead. Looking forward, I can visualize great opportunities lie ahead for higher milk production, speedy collection of milk with high quality and introduction of new innovative products. We will have to focus on training programs for employees of the Union as well as society level employees, in the field of animal treatment, animal breeding and animal husbandry for expansion of business. We all have to remain committed for the overall progress of our Union. Entire milk collection from societies through bulk milk coolers is in the final phase which shall be completed speedily. In consonance with the policies framed by Government of Gujarat, Indian origin breed of milch animals are preferred. There is also more demand for milk fat in India for which we will have to plan to set up mega

farms. We need to speed up our plan to establish 500 large farms with 100 animals each with a view toincrease milk production.
Amul feed parlours established by the Union has received good response from members. Considering this, Union plans to establish ten moreAmul feedparlours.
During the year under review, milk procurement has increased 20% more as compared to previous year. Considering the increasing procurement and increase in market demand of milk and curd, we have planned capacity expansion of milk processing and packing to the tune of 3.0 lakh litres and 30 MT curd per day. With the objective to properly utilize enhanced milk procurement, we need to plan capacity expansion of Amul -3 Plant so that we can

KAIRA DISTRICTCO-OPERATIVE MILK PRODUCER'SUNION LIMITED I 2018-2019









process additional 4.50 lakh litres milk per day. Simultaneously, at Anand plant, we plan to establish Continuous Butter making machine having capacity of 5.00 MT per hour and establish Butter re-work line so as to make 100 gm,200 gm and500 gm butter frombulk butter. For storage of butter, we have planned tomake new Refrigerated Warehouse so that we can save on warehouse rentals. In expanding our customer base, it is primary requirement to ensure quality of products. In order to provide hygienic milk and milk products, we have established a Product Innovation Centre at Anand, where we plan to develop energy drinks.
During the year under review, Union has established a new chocolate plant having capacity to produce 30 MTChocolates perday. At this plant, various types of chocolates like "Gems'; "Bar'' and"Centre Fill Spiller Balls" etc. will be produced. With a view to meet increasing demand of Chocozoo and Chocomini,  a  new  line  is  planned  to  be established for production of the same. It is also planned to establish a new processing line for Bread Spread, with a capacity to process 1.50 kilo liter per hour so as to enhance Bread Spread production to the tune of 400 MT per month. In order to meet the increasing demand of Cookies and Rusk, we will have to increase production capacity Cookies to 45.00 MT per month and that of Rusk to 30 MT per month. Amul will also have to increase the production of pure quality sweets for which steps to install a plant with production capacity of 3.00 MT per day is already initiated.
With a view to increase the production capacity of cheese, we are going for expansion of Cheddar Cheese Plant at Khatraj. It is required to develop new varieties of cheese looking to consumer demands. As a part of introducing new products, we plan to establish UHTline for mulTru' with a capacity toproduce 24,000 packsper hour.


To make available speedy and online information to members of Societies, we plan to establish AMCS Kiosk (Amul Automatic Milk Collection System). With the establishment of this system, a member can get information about the milk given by him to society, fat and thepayment details.
Considering expanding market demand in Kolkata for Amul Milk, Curd, Butter Milk, Mishti Dahi and Paneer, Union has bought its own land where steps for establishing new Dairy Plant with capacity to process 12.00 lakh liters per day willhave tobeundertaken.
During the year under review, considering expanding market demand in Mumbai for Paneer and Lassi, Union has planned to establish a new Paneer plant with capacity to manufacture 5.00 MT Paneer per day as well astoestablish new Lassi Plant with capacity to manufacture 5,000 liters Lassi per day.
We have achieved a record turnover of 6.966 Crores for which we have faced many difficulties. We have procured 121.69 Crore kgs.of milk and processed the same. We could achieve this milestone only because of our commitment, skillful management, strategic planning, creation  of  new business opportunities, establishment of new plants and its expansion, cooperation from societies and your wholehearted support. However, in today's changing scenario, to sustain and maintain growth, weneedto work together and adopt latest technologies and work selflessly for the development and progress of our farmer members. Unless we inculcate innovative ideas, change our approach and synthesize with new business, it will be difficult for us to compete with big multinational companies. It is my humble request to allof you to join hands and work together for the welfare of milk producers, without worrying about internal or external pressures. Our Amul has achieved great success because of dedicated management, devoted workforce and support of milk producer members.

DetailsofExpensesExceedingBudget During FY2018-19 Revenue Expense:s

1. Increase in Milk Transportation costs is due to increase in overall milk procurement by 11.24% as compared to Previous year, and also due to net increase in Diesel rates by approx. 14% as compared to previous year.

2. There is increase  in Interest  and Bank  Commission  by approximately  10%. This is on account of substantial increase in milk procuremetnin Gujarat to the tune of almost 20% resulting into higher inventories mainly of milk powders. This in turn resulted in higher working capital borrowingsfrom Banks as compared to previous year. There has also been increasein the interest rates by Banks duringFY 2018-19 ascompared toFY 2017-18
